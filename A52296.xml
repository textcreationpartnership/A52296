            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>What is meant by a Contempt of the World.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Do not deſign to Entertain the Reader with only ſome Witty Extemporary Thoughts upon this Subject, in the way which generally Eſſays are wrote in, where greater Care for the moſt is taken to ſay ſomething Fine and Surprizing, than Good and Uſeful; and where 'tis looked upon more Airy and Gentleman-like to leave all the Thoughts looſe and undigeſted, than to be too much cramped up in a Scho ar-like Method. Some Extraordinary Gentlemen who have wrote in that kind, have purpoſely avoided Method, becauſe it looks too like
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97801:10"/>
the Schools and the Sermon-makers, and for that Reaſon might never happen to be read. <hi>Mountaign,</hi> a Man of a peculiar Genius, and a Wit that ſurprizes moſt by rambling from his Subject, and ſticking to no Method (we may call him the French <hi>Pindar</hi>) he has done admirably well this way; but I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome who have Imitated him in this, have been alike ſucceſsful. But be this as it will, I will venture, like a blunt Scholar, to tell my Reader before-hand what I have to ſay, and to lay down before him the Method I deſign in this Treatiſe to purſue.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. Therefore I will ſhew what is meant by the Contempt of the World.</item>
                  <item>II. I ſhall rectify ſome miſtakes about it.</item>
                  <item>III. I ſhall ſhew in what it conſiſts.</item>
                  <item>IV. I ſhall ſhew what Reaſons we have for to endeavour after it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. To ſhew what is meant by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World. Now by Contemning the World, I do not mean any ſowre diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every thing about us, nor a haughty diſreſpect and undervaluing of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thinking none of them good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us; <hi>but ſuch an indifferency to every thing which relates only to this Life, ſuch as Wit,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97801:10"/>
Learning, Beauty, Honour, Riches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as ſhews that we chiefly value the things of the other World, and only take up with theſe as a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subſiſtance and Bait, as we are going on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in our Journey to Heaven.</hi> Now this is not a Virtue purely Moral, and which we might have come to the knowledge of by the Light of Nature without Revelation: for certainly we Chriſtians are more obliged to contemn the World than the Heathens were, who knew of no other World than this. They indeed were obliged to uſe the good things of this World agreeably to the Rules of Temperance and Sobriety, ſo as not to make themſelves, by the Enjoyment of them, Sots and Beaſts. But it could never be expected that they, who had no Revelation of another Life after this, ſhould be ſo perfectly liſtleſs and indifferent to this Worlds Pleaſures, as thoſe who expect Pleaſures of another ſort at God's <hi>Right hand for evermore.</hi> They were not aſſured of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life after this, till God <hi>brought Life and Immortality to light through the Goſpel;</hi> and therefore they in reaſon ought to Husband this Lifes Goods as well as they could, and to ſet a greater value upon them than we ought in reaſon to do; but 'tis our Duty to be very eaſily ſatisfied with any ſmall Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God is pleaſed to give us of them; not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97801:11"/>
eagerly to wiſh to get them, nor to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them when we have them, but to look upon them very ſmall and inconſiderable in compariſon with the Happineſs of the other World, and to be ready to part with the deareſt of them, when they come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the means of attaining that. This is a Duty which the Holy Scripture does in very many places inculcate, as well in the Old Teſtament as in the New. The holy Patriarch is ſo far from Idolizing the good things of this World, that though God had bleſſed him with Flocks and Herds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he complains, that <hi>few and evil had been the days of his Pilgrimage,</hi> Gen. 47.9. Thus the Pſalmiſt bids us, <hi>not to truſt in oppreſſion, and if riches increaſe not to ſet our heart upon them,</hi> Pſal. 62.10. And Holy <hi>Job</hi> maintains his Integrity becauſe <hi>he had not made Gold his hope, nor ſaid to fine Gold thou art my confidence,</hi> Job 31.24. But the New Teſtament is full of Inſtructions and Exhortations to this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luk. 14.25. So again, he delivers a whole diſcourſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. upon this Subject, and particularly commands us <hi>not to ſeek what we ſhall eat, or what we ſhall drink,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97801:11"/>
to ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto us.</hi> So the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.31. bids us <hi>uſe the World as not abuſing it.</hi> And he tells us, <hi>God forbid that he ſhould glory, ſave only in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus, by whom the world is Crucified unto him, and he unto the world,</hi> Gal. 6.14. So <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, &amp; 2. He exhorts us to <hi>ſeek thoſe things that are above,</hi> and <hi>to ſet our affections on things above and not on things below.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. He <hi>counts all things loſs for the excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, for whom</hi> he <hi>had</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>the loſs of all things, and</hi> did <hi>count</hi> them <hi>but Dung that</hi> he might be <hi>with Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe commands us not <hi>to love the World, neither the things that are in the World. If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2 15. And St. <hi>James</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, That <hi>the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God, whoſoever therefore will be the friend of the world is the enemy of God,</hi> Jam. 4.4. This is ſufficient to ſhew that the whole tenor of the Goſpel does recommend to us a Contempt of Worldly things, in compariſon of our eternal happineſs; and does withal inform us, what is meant by ſuch a Contempt of the World.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the uſual Miſtakes concerning the Contempt of the World.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>EVery Chriſtian is perſwaded that the things of this World are to be deſpiſed, but every one is not convinced in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he is to do it; every Man follows his own Method, and is for Contemning the World after his way. Now the miſtakes which ariſe upon this Account may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe two Heads;
<list>
                     <item>1. Either ſuch as ariſe from the Nature of the thing it ſelf; or,</item>
                     <item>2. Such as ariſe from Mens Prejudices concerning them.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Of thoſe which ariſe from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelf; and thoſe are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Miſtake in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling things indifferent.</note>I. To think a Contempt of the World, does conſiſt in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ill Names upon the good things of the World, and giving them odious Repreſentations. This may be indeed out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97801:12"/>
of a Pious deſign, to make Men the more out of Love with them; but then it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in contradiction to Truth, and to the diſparagement of Gods Creation. And thus they do that call <hi>Beauty</hi> nothing elſe but a Painted Sepulchre, but Corruption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, to be like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Beautiful without, and nothing but Duſt within; That call <hi>Honour</hi> nothing but the breath of the Multitude, a Popular Wind; and the like. So others call the <hi>Riches</hi> of the World, <hi>Gold and Silver,</hi> &amp;c. a little ſhining Dirt, a little beautified Earth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than the reſt but only in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Covetous Mad-men; That account great Poſſeſſions to be but the lucky hit of a few Fools that are Chanced to be Born to them; that ſerve to no purpoſe but to make themſelves uneaſie under them, and other People to Gape after them. They eſteem Mens Natural Abilities, their quickneſs of Parts, and ſtrength of Reaſon, to be but a little flaſh of Thought, to entertain Wiſe People, and to perplex Silly ones. Now 'tis an eaſie thing for Men of good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and a keen Temper, to Rally upon, and to Undervalue any thing; Nay, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the ſame effect. Of Ancient Time, the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Philoſophers were remarkable for this,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97801:13"/>
who were wont to Snarle at every thing that did not Suit with their Crabbed Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to take every thing by the worſt han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and to invent tart Sayings upon the beſt things to make them look ridiculous. Hence they got the Name of Cynicks, or the Sect of Dogs. And we have too, in our time, many People that think they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good Chriſtians, if they can get but a little of this Cant in their Mouths, and talk o'r ſome poor ſilly Declamation in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement of thoſe things which God has made purpoſely to be admired. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Beauteous Perſonage is a great Bleſſing, unleſs abuſed to Evil purpoſes. Thus it was beſtow'd as a Bleſſing upon the Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to have beautiful Wives, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.27. And it was one of the Comforts of <hi>Job</hi> after his Calamities, that <hi>there were no Women found ſo fair as the Daughters of</hi> Job, <hi>Job</hi> 42.15. And the Pſalmiſt Prays it as a Bleſſing upon his People, <hi>that their Daughters may be Beauteous as the poliſhed corners of the Temple,</hi> Pſal. 144.12. Nay, God himſelf, who does uſually illuſtrate his own Perfections by the reſemblance of ſome Perfection we find in Humane Nature, does frequently expreſs his Glory by the Name of Beauty, <hi>Job</hi> 40.10 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 4.2. So likewiſe, 1
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97801:13"/>
                  <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.12. Riches and Honour are ſaid to be beſtowed by God. <hi>Both Riches and Honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all.</hi> So <hi>Job,</hi> 1.10. <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>ſubſtance increaſed in the Land becauſe God bleſſed the work of his hands.</hi> And God promiſes to the good Man <hi>that feareth the Lord,</hi> that <hi>wealth and riches ſhall be in his Houſe,</hi> Pſal. 112.3. So Wiſdom is ſaid to come from God, <hi>Job</hi> 28.20. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt begs of God to <hi>teach him to know Wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. And the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.26. tells us, that <hi>God giveth to a man Wiſdom.</hi> Now to go about to undervalue and to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe things which God has deſign'd for Bleſſings and Benefits, muſt be ſo far from being our Duty, that it muſt be a very great fault, or at leaſt a very dangerous miſtake; for generally this Cuſtom does proceed from a malicious, or invidious temper, when men are ſowred with Diſcontent or Envy; they do not find fault with theſe things becauſe they are blame-worthy, but becauſe they themſelves do not poſſeſs them. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let them do it out of what deſign they will, the Actions can never be Juſtifiable, not only becauſe they, by that, undervalue ſome of Gods choiceſt Bleſſings, but becauſe they hinder Mens Gratitude, which they ought to pay to God for ſuch Favors received. For if Beauty, and Wealth and Honor be ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97801:14"/>
contemptible things, that are rather Plagues than Bleſſings: To what purpoſe ſhould we thank God for that which we are ne're the better for his beſtowing? Thus we ſee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Advancing</hi> Religion, ſome Men deſtroy the beſt Part of all Religion, a <hi>Thankfulneſs for God's Mercies.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">In Cenſuring what they do not like.</note>II. 'Tis a Miſtake to think, that a Contempt of the World doth conſiſt in cenſuring the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others which they do not approve of, though in themſelves they are unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 'Tis obſervable, that Perſons who are addicted to ſuch a way of Living, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſuch kind of Talk, Company, Garb or Diverſions, are ſo prejudiced againſt any thing elſe that is different from it, as to take it for little leſs than Prophane and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.

our Modern Faſhions; and yet take as much Pride themſelves in keeping up to an old an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated Dreſs, which has hardly been in Uſe this Century. I have known a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has thought he has ſhown a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Contempt of the World, by talking againſt Drinking, and has Condemned ſome, which he never knew Guilty of any Exceſs that way, only for miſpending their Time, and waſting the Creature, and yet the ſame Perſon has Hunted all the Week, and ſpent more in Horſe-fleſh in a Month, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſpent in Wine in a Year. I have known another, that would make a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Loſing Two Pence at Cards, whilſt he was Playing a Guinea at Bowels. I have ſeen others, who have Condemned all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of common Exerciſes and Diverſions, and yet have ſpent a great deal more Time in Riding, or Walking, or Santering about; And yet in the mean time they Fancy this is Living in a Contempt of the World, and that they muſt needs ſet their <hi>Affections on things above,</hi> when they paſs ſuch a ſevere Cenſure <hi>on things below.</hi> But ſuch Perſons ſhould do well to conſider, that the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Illneſs of ſuch Actions, does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their Averſion to them, but upon their Agreement or Diſagreement to God's Commands, and the Occaſion of Sin, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97801:15"/>
may probably follow upon them. Thus, to be <hi>Merry</hi> and <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> is no more ſinful, than to be <hi>Serious</hi> and <hi>Thoughtful,</hi> and one argues an ill Man no more than the other. Certainly, God did not make Religion only for the Phlegmatick and Melancholy, for down-looks and diſtorted Countenances; as if it were the Mark of a Saint to look ſad and ghaſtly, and to walk about like a ſullen ſpeechleſs Apparition. An Innocent Mirth is the peculiar Priviledge of good Men, for all others have cauſe to Sorrow. Nor do I think <hi>Singing and Dancing</hi> to be ſuch foul Crimes, as ſome Puritanical Sermons, in the Days of our Fore-fathers would beſpeak them to be; though 'tis certain they may be abuſed to evil Purpoſes: And ſo our ordinary Food may be perverted to Gluttony, and our Drink to Drunkenneſs; which yet does not abridge us of the lawful Uſe of either. I cannot ſee how any innocent <hi>Recreation,</hi> or <hi>Paſtime,</hi> which is allowed by Law, ſhould be ſinful in it ſelf, more than Riding or Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the only Fault I can eſpy, is only in the Circumſtances, as when Men Play for too much, or too long, or at unſeaſonable Times, or when they are of ſuch a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as are thereby frequently irritated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paſſion, or the like. So again, as for <hi>going Habited</hi> in the <hi>Faſhion</hi> of the Time we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97801:15"/>
live in, can be no Sin, unleſs to wear any Cloaths at all be ſo: For if we muſt wear ſome Cloaths, Why not thoſe of our own Time, rather than thoſe of any other? Why ſhould we run up to the old <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> for the Cut of our Garments? Or why ſhould we go twenty years backwards for a Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? There is certainly leſs of Pride in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Faſhion come to us, than in running back thirty years for that. There is no more Sin in Wearing the Garb of Ninety three, than of Fifty three; only the Latter argues more Pride, becauſe it argues more ſingularity. If we take care not to run the firſt into every new Faſhion, but to take it up with our Neighbours as it comes? if we do not ſpend too much time, nor value our ſelves upon them; if we do not affect to be in the Extreams of every new Humor, nor to go above our Quality, or diſagreeable to our Age or Profeſſion, we may wear what we will, and let moroſe People talk what they pleaſe: For the Uſe of Cloaths in the World, is as well to diſtinguiſh Qualities, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend from the Weather: ſo that 'tis as much a Fault for Perſons of better Rank to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go themſelves, as it is for the Meaner to go above.</p>
               <p>I confeſs they have the moſt to ſay againſt <hi>Drinking,</hi> becauſe it does ſo often occaſion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97801:16"/>
Sin. Now though I eſteem Drunkenneſs, or a conſtant Sotting, though it has not that Effect to be one of the beaſtlieſt things Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature is guilty of, yet a Glaſs or two in the Entertainment of a Friend, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing of Buſineſs, can be no means unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable; if we be ſure to keep a wide Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Bounds of Intemperance, both in our ſelves and in others. For why ſhould a Glaſs or two of Wine be more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance than a Collation of Sweetmeats? Or why ſhould we be condemned for Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that when we are not adry, more than for eating theſe when we are not an hungred? All theſe Actions, and a great many more of the ſame Nature, may be Good or Ill, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are uſed; but to condemn all Perſons for the Uſe of theſe things, is as unreaſonable, as to condemn every one that uſes either Water or Fire, or Knives or Swords, becauſe it is poſſible that they may uſe all theſe things to their own Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is not a Contempt of the World, but only of ſuch things we perhaps take no Pleaſure in doing: Nay, it is ſo far from contemning the World, that it is the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and Cheriſhing two very Worldly Affections: I mean, Uncharitableneſs and Self-Love, when we, without Ground, paſs a too ſevere Cenſure upon the Actions of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97801:16"/>
our innocent Neighbour, and would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing our Humors and Inclinations as a Rule of his Actions.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Second ſort of Miſtakes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Contempt of the World, are ſuch which ariſes from Men's Prejudices; becauſe they are ſome way or other, by ſome Vice, or Paſſion, or Conſtitution, or Infirmity, diſpoſed to ſpeak againſt the Actions of the Generality of the World; and this they take to be the true Chriſtian Contempt of it. And this is evident,</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Miſtakes from Ill Nature.</note> In Perſons of an ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We all know that Nature has not made us all of the ſame Mould; ſome Tempers ſhe has made of the fineſt Contexture, and others ſeem to have come out of her Hands but rough Work. Some Natures are of that ſoft, even, delicate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that they ſeem to be framed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the good of the World; they are ſo full of Love and Kindneſs, and Goodneſs, ſo full of Charity and Generoſity, that they are unwilling to diſoblige any one; they take a Pride in advancing the Fame, and Honour, and Welfare of others, and ſeem to take it to heart, to hear of the Miſcarriages or ill Repute of any they converſe with, and will tenter their Charity to the utmoſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97801:17"/>
ſtretch to conceive, if poſſible, a favorable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them. So again, others are of that rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged warp'd Diſpoſition, that they ſeem to bear a good Affection to no body; that like Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hogs, lie wrapt up within themſelves, and turn out their Prickels to every one elſe; that are in a manner made up with Vinegar, ſo as to ſowre and curdle upon every thing, and to like nothing but what they do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I am unwilling to charge all this ill Temper, which we may find too much of in the World, upon Nature only; but I believe 'tis Nature, though none of the beſt, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated with Pride and Malice, which runs into this ugly Contexture, and that does ſo much Miſchief, and occaſions ſo much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the World. Now People of this Temper delight always to be biting and ſnarling at what others do or ſay; that would be picking out Faults where there are none, and are glad upon all Occaſions to meet with Failures in other Men, only to give themſelves the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Railing at them. Now a great many ſuch kind of Men ſet up for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Contempt of the World, becauſe they find themſelves ſo keen and ſharp againſt the common Occurrences in it; but this is more of the Deviliſh, than of the Chriſtian Spirit, for that <hi>wicked One</hi> has his Office and his Name from Accuſing and Calumniating. Such
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97801:17"/>
Men are rather <hi>Haters, than Contemners of the World;</hi> a Company of Curriſh <hi>Timons,</hi> that love Barking for Barking Sake, that rather like the World the better for being bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it finds them Entertainment enough for their Spleen. Now, the good Chriſtian that does really, out of an honeſt Heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the World, is heartily ſorry for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and Miſcarriages of Human Kind, and does wiſh that they were fully amended; but theſe, like Toads and Adders, grow fat upon the Poyſon of the World; 'tis their Meat and Drink to find faults, to be railing at. The good Chriſtian that condemns the World, and the prophane Practices of it, has an exemplary Life to witneſs for him, that he does it out of a pure Conſcience; but the ill natur'd Railer, is one who has no other Pretence to Vertue, but by talking againſt Vice; they are generally Men of the worſt Morals, that take up with this ſort of Sat r, only as a blind, or a Jugling-Box to deceive, the Peoples Eyes, by diverting them from their own Vices, thereby to gain the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of calling Whore firſt. Their Buſineſs is to Gall and Fret the World, more than to deſpiſe it; and if they can but give others Diſquiet, their Work is done. But 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that ſuch rather deſire the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſquiet of Men, than their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97801:18"/>
becauſe, when by their Railing, they have effected what they deſigned, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than want ſomething to rail at, they wi l be pulling down their own Work with their own Tongues.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">From Old Age.</note>II. Some do miſtake the Effects of <hi>Old Age</hi> for a true Contempt of the World. It is certain, that according to the diverſe Stages of our Life, we are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entertained with diverſity of Objects. When we are Children, we like nothing ſo well a, Rattles and Hobby-Horſes; when we grow Men, Wit and Knowledge, and Pleaſure and Fame are more apt to Delight us; and ſome of theſe too wear off again from us as we grow old. 'Tis a Miſtake therefore to fancy, that we are arrived to a Contempt of the World, when we are only come to ſuch a Period of Age; we do not then deſpiſe thoſe worldly Pleaſures, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we know not how to reliſh them. I have known a Lady that had ſpent her Youth in the moſt frothy Vanity you can imigine, and as Age came on, ſhe has plum'd her ſelf, and cry'd, how ſhe deſpiſed the World! when moſt People gueſſed the true Reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the World began to deſpiſe her. 'Tis no great Wonder why a Gentlewoman of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſhould take no Pleaſure in Dancing a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97801:18"/>
Jigg; or that a Man, who had deſtroyed Nature before Forty, ſhould at Sixty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud himſelf for the Averſion he had arriv'd to, both to Wine and Women. This can be no more ſaid to be a Contempt of the World, than a Man can be ſaid to walk down Stairs, who is tumbled down Headlong. This is a Defect of Nature, and not an overcoming of it: This is far better, no doubt, than what thoſe lewd old People do, who pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Sins of their Youth, and when Nature is grown decrepit, enjoy their Vices over again in Imagination. But however, this is far enough from the Vertue which we treat of, for this conſiſts in conflicting with the Pleaſures we are able to enjoy, and not in ſlighting thoſe we cannot. The beſt way for ancient Perſons to try whither they are arrived to a Contempt of the World or no, is to ſee how they can comport themſelves, when thoſe Inclinations are croſt, which are moſt incident to old Age. Let them try if they can bear the Loſs of a Bag of Gold with as little Impatience as the Diſappointment of a Ball or a merry Meeting: And then I will ſay, indeed they are arrived to a compleat Contempt of the World. But generally this Carping at the Actions of young People, is rather the Infirmity of Old Age, than any Virtue; ſuch as that Age of Man's Life has
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97801:19"/>
always been remarkable for; as <hi>Horace</hi> has obſerved ſeventeen hundred years ago.</p>

the natural Peeviſhneſs and Queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of their Temper, or at leaſt have diſguiſed it: For Reaſon it ſelf ſhews that there can be no Ground for it.

'Tis the Deſign of Nature to gratifie theſe diverſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites one after another; and we may as well expect to have their Conſtitutions alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before their time as their Inclinations.

                  <hi>Sickneſs and Weakneſs of Body</hi> makes ſome think alſo, That they are arrived to a true Contempt of the World. When ſome Perſons, thro' Infirmity of Body, find, that they do not reliſh the Pleaſures of the World, they are preſently apt to fancy, that they perfectly contemn them; but I am afraid a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them really do not. For a Contempt of the World does not conſiſt in a bare not enjoying its Pleaſures, but in refuſing them when they ſollicit us. If the former only were the Virtue, Trees and Stones might pretend to it as well as we, becauſe they feel no Satisfaction from the Pleaſures of the World neither. Such a Contempt of the World, which ariſes on y from Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Body, is like a full-cram'd Gluttons Contempt of a Feaſt, not becauſe he does not like it, but becauſe he cannot taſt it. I have known a certain Ingenious Gentleman in the Nation, who, very young, happened
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97801:21"/>
to fall into very bad Company, and broke a good Conſtitution before Eight and twenty; I have heard this Gentleman, under this Condition, make as pretty Declamations againſt the Vanity of what we call'd Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as moſt you'll find among the old Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> and has ſeriouſly declared with what a wonderful Contempt he look'd down upon thoſe trifles, which he formerly did, and which the World doth ſtill make ſuch Account of. And yet when the ſame Perſon, by the Care of a good Phyſician and ſtrength of Youth, had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Diſtemper, he preſently changed his Sentiments with his courſe of Life again; he relaps'd into as much Lewdneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs as before, and became a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for thoſe very Crimes he under his Sickneſs did with ſo much Wit and Reaſon expoſe. 'Tis plain here was not ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World as was pretended, and that it was the Incapacity only which Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs created, that gave the pretended Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Indeed, Sickneſs is often a good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to the Contempt of the World; it is like the ſtreightning a Stick towards the bending it the other way, and God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty often ſends it for this end: For not to perceive the Pleaſures of the World, is one ſtep towards the deſpiſing them; but for the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97801:21"/>
true Contempt we muſt go yet higher, and deſpiſe them whither we can reliſh the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them or no. We muſt deſpiſe them at the ſame time when our Nature prompts us to deſire them, even when our Fleſh and Blood are hankering after them, when Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations beat ſtrong upon us from without, and Grace only and Religion do reſiſt within.</p>

                  <hi>Diſcontent</hi> is often taken by ſome for the genuine contempt of the World. When Mens tempers are ſowred by ſome great misfortune they have met withal in their buſineſs or deſigns, which leaves ſuch a damp upon their ſpirits, that they take but little comfort in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World, they forthwith ſet up for a contempt of it. The World frowns upon them, and they are reſolved to be even with it; and to rail at the World. This is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be ſeen in many diſcarded Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites at Court, who becauſe they cannot enjoy all the World, they will enjoy none of it; whoſe Ambition has met with a check for mounting ſo high, and ſo moves down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, not out of any natural tendency, but only by a forcible rebound. Thus in other Countreys diſappointed Greatneſs, deſpiſed Pride, unfortunate Amours, fill up their Convents with People, who would like the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97801:22"/>
World well enough, if it did not croſs their Humours. But certainly this is ſo far from being a Chriſtian Vertue, that it is one of the worſt ſort of Vices, 'tis an inſupportable piece of Pride and Arrogance; and a fooliſh Impotence of Mind. They have not all that their Ambition unjuſtly calls for, and therefore they deſpiſe that which they may lawfully enjoy. Like Stomachful Children, who, if they cannot have what they like beſt, will eat nothing at all. They are ſo far from the true Chriſtian Contempt which <hi>overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the World,</hi> that they let every little ſilly accident of the World overcome them, and make perfect ſlaves of their minds. The true Chriſtian lets the afflictions of the World fly over his Head, but theſe ſuffer them to light upon them with ſuch force and power, as to make them to lie ſtrugling and groveling under them. Such Mens exclaiming againſt the World is no ſign of their contempt of it any more, than an unſucceſsful Lover can be ſaid to hate his Miſtreſs; when his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt her does not ſhew he has no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her, but only a fruitleſs one. We find in Scripture two as wicked Men as are perhaps recorded there, to have deſpiſed all the good things of the World, and to have enjoyed n thing of all that great affluence they were provided with, becauſe they had
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97801:22"/>
met with a diſappointment in their deſires. The firſt is the proud <hi>Haman,</hi> that great Miniſter of State to <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the mighty <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, who had the chief power under the King <hi>over a hundred and ſeventy Provinces,</hi> that cou'd boaſt <hi>of the glory of his Riches, and the multitude of his Children, and all the things wherein the King had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted him, and how he had advanced him above the Servants of the King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet all this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>availeth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai <hi>the Jew ſitting at the Kings Gate,</hi> Eſther 5.13. This Man you ſee could enjoy none of all theſe Worldly pleaſures he was ſo amply provided with; his deſpiſed Pride, and the reſpect which was denied him by a poor <hi>Jew,</hi> made all theſe glories, which the greateſt Men did deſire, and ſo few could attain to, perfectly flat and inſipid; nay, he perfectly deſpiſes them all in compariſon of that ſweet revenge, he hopes to take upon his ſtiff Adverſary. And yet no one can call this a Contempt of the World, becauſe it is rather a Worſhipping and Idolizing a ſmall and contemptible part of it, an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable punctilio of Worldly Honour, which every Wiſe Man ought to deſpiſe; but yet it made ſuch an impreſſion upon this great Man, that it ſwallowed up all the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights he might have enjoyed, and made
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97801:23"/>
him rather chooſe to be miſerable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than not to be valued by another. The ſecond Inſtance is that of King <hi>Ahab,</hi> who though he poſſeſſed all the Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of a Crown; yet becauſe he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of the purchaſe of a poor Mans Vineyard, the ſoft delights of his Palace give no reliſh to him upon this diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but amidſt all the Luxurious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of an Eaſtern Court, <hi>he laid him down upon his Bed, and turned away his Face, and would eat no Bread,</hi> 2 King. 21.4. Now this fooliſh Prince was ſo far from contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, that he doted upon it; his Vanity or Covetouſneſs or both had got that aſcendant over him, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer his Life to be miſerable, than to want ſome additional Happineſs he fancied he ſhould acquire, by poſſeſſing that poors Mans Inheritance. Therefore the beſt way to try, when we lie under diſcontent, whether our contempt of the World be true and genuine, and ſuch as the Goſpel doth recommend, is to conſider whether or no we ſhould deſpiſe the World at the ſame rate, if the cauſes of our Diſcontent were removed; if we ſhould after the ſame manner undervalue Riches, and Pleaſures, and Honours, in a mighty affluence of all theſe, as when we are in the greateſt want of them; if we do Deſpiſe the World
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97801:23"/>
out of Love to God, and Obedience to his Commands, and not out of Love to our ſelves, and to gratifie our own Spleen and Paſſions; if our neglect of all Worldly things is bottomed upon the Excellency of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Natures, upon the greatneſs of our everlaſting Reward in Heaven, to which not only the Sufferings, but all the <hi>Enjoyments of this preſent World are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</hi> But to deſpiſe and undervalue the World upon any other Account, beſpeaks us only to be of a peeviſh angry temper, not to have a mind to improve our Religion by it, but only to vent our Spleen. And indeed, no one will like the World the leſs for ſuch Railing againſt it any more than they will believe Diſcarded Favourites, Deſpairing Amoretto's, and Disbanded Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when they Rail againſt their Princes, their Miſtreſſes, or their Commanders. I have now done with the miſtakes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Contempt of the World</hi> I thought fit to mention, and I proceed to ſhew in what a Contempt of the World does conſiſt.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97801:24"/>
of and extolled by the Heathens, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe was rather Pride than any thing elſe. We find the Stoicks Books full of this kind of Declamation; They are all for Magnifying this ſort of Temper, which they thought they had framed for themſelves, by appearing above the reſt of the World, by making themſelves in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Gods, and the reſt of the World Slaves and Fools. They did not ſo much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to raiſe in the World a great Opinion of Virtue, as one of themſelves, and all thoſe great Elogiums they invented upon the Contempt of Pleaſure, and the Philoſophical Happineſs in the midſt of Miſery, ſeem'd rather deſign'd upon the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than their Subject: For if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hiſtory of the Antients, we ſhall find, that few of all the Antient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, excepting only <hi>Socrates,</hi> (whom we may call an inſpired Heathen, and a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Chriſtianity) but lived contrary to the Opinions they profeſt: And indeed, the Principles they went upon were too weak to ſupport that Greatneſs of Mind which they pretended to: For there is no reaſon Abſolutely to deſpiſe the good Things of this World, and to raiſe our Minds ſo far above them, as not to think them worth our regarding in themſelves, For the Fabrick
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97801:25"/>
of the Univerſe is a moſt glorious and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Compoſure, the Pleaſures of the Earth are Entertaining and Delightful, and are the ſubject of no Man's Contempt ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. But when we conſider them in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the Joys of another World, then they ſeem ſuch little empty Nothings, that any Wiſe Man muſt contemn and undervalue them, when he has his Eye fixed upon that Bleſſed State of Immortality. Now, becauſe the Philoſophers and others among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, had no Revelation of this other State, they could not upon theſe juſt grounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the good Things of this World; and therefore when they pretended to it, their Averſion ſeemed bottomed chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Pride, or Moroſeneſs, or at leaſt an Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Singularity. But we Chriſtians have all the Reaſon in the World to put on a Spirit of Magnanimity, and to have our Souls raiſed above the reſt of Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot turn our Eyes upon any part almoſt of our Religion, but we find enough ſatisfaction to elevate the moſt Drooping Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As firſt, when we conſider barely our Profeſſion, how we ſtand diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World, that <hi>God has called us with an holy calling,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. <hi>that we are a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97801:25"/>
Nation, a peculiar People,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are ſufficient to raiſe our Minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Worldly Satisfactions, and make us look on them as mean and pitiful Things, <hi>if we have that true ſenſe of them which we ought to have.</hi> For what greater Honour can we poſſibly attain to, than this of our Chriſtian Profeſſion? We are wont ſtrangely to overvalue, to talk, and think mighty things of our ſelves, when we are raiſed to a higher ſtep of Honour than we were before; only becauſe our Prince has vouchſafed to lend to us a Beam or two of his Dignity, and has given us a ſpecial Badge or Character to be diſtinguiſhed from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Nation. We are apt to rate our ſelves ſomething higher in our own Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we conſider how much we ſtand in the Favour of ſo great a Perſon. But when we conſider, that we Chriſtians are the Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the Great God of Heaven and Earth, that we receive our Title from the King of Kings, who is ten thouſand times more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the moſt puiſſant Monarch, than he is above the meaneſt of his Subjects; when we conſider that he has given us this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character of our Profeſſion, that he himſelf has directed us to a Calling, thereby to be diſtinguiſhed from the confuſed Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Mankind; this ſhould in ſpirit our Souls with ſuch noble Thoughts and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97801:26"/>
as ſhould make us ſeem above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing we ſee about us here: For what Honour can Riches or Titles reflect upon us, when we are already inveſted with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Honour from God himſelf? Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhall ſhamefully diſgrace the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Profeſſion, if we let others value themſelves more upon a few empty Titles, which are only guilded Names, a few Words or Syllables, which the People are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak with Reſpect, than we do this Dignity of our Chriſtian Profeſſion, which we have delivered to us by the Hand and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our great Great Creator.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee moſt Men that have taken up any kind of Calling or Profeſſion, whether Liberal or otherways, do retain an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Reſpect and Veneration for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Profeſſion, and do Pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in being Followers of ſo eminent a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Generation. Thus we find, that not only Monks and Friers do think they have an Honour derived upon them from the Founders of their reſpective Orders, but even Mechanicks are wont to ſet a Value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves from the Reputation of the Author of their Myſtery. But none came up in this Point to the ancient Philoſophers (who were very good Judges of the Reaſon of Things) for they ſeem often times in a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97801:26"/>
manner tranſported, when they reflect upon the Honour they received from being Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Followers of the Great Maſters and Authors of their Sect. We may perceive ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often <hi>Lucretius</hi> to leave his Subject, to run Panegyricks upon his admired Maſter <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> Nay, <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> frequently break a Period to commend <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Zeno.</hi> But what are all theſe to the Author of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, God, Bleſſed for ever?</hi> Theſe 'tis true, were great Men, and famous in their Generations, who have bleſſed the World with curious Inventions, and admirable Sciences; but <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> the Founder of our Chriſtian Religion, is no leſs than the eternal Son of God, that came down from Heaven, left his Father's Boſom, emptied himſelf, and eclipſed his eternal Glory, to plant this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion here below, <hi>to purifie himſelf a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, zealous of good Works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. Now, if the good Fortune of a Lucky Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, if the great Wit and Study of a learned Philoſopher, if the ſtrict Rules and Methods of a rigid Aſcetick can reflect ſo much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon their Followers, as to look upon themſelves on that account the Nobler and Happier: To what Hights and Elevations of Mind ſhould our Souls be raiſed, whoſe Profeſſion is of ſo Divine Original, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97801:27"/>
of whoſe Religion, is as far above <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato, Zeno</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> as the eternal Wiſdom of God is above the ſlight Sophiſms and Conjectures in Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we look but upon the admirable Rules of our Holy Religion, by which it ſtands diſtinguiſhed, both from the Law Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Judicial; we muſt needs have our Minds raiſed to a peculiar Degree of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as being thought worthy to be the Profeſſors of ſo pure a Doctrine. How do the Philoſophers in their Books, applaud their great Happineſs, by having attained to the wiſe Rules and Precepts of Morality, that they by theſe were enabled to live like Men, whilſt the greateſt part of Mankind lived <hi>more pecudum,</hi> like Beaſts in Stupidity and Senſuality? And yet the greateſt Hights that their Philoſophers could attain to, fell vaſtly ſhort of thoſe admirable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which are enjoyned by our Bleſſed Saviour. To ſee in our Religion, a devout Saint denying his Affections, Crucifying his Fleſh, and abridging himſelf, not only of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and Superfluous, but almoſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Enjoyments, to live with that Exactneſs, as expecting always to die, and to die with that Chearfulneſs, as being to live for ever, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Perſecution and Torments, not only with tranquility and compoſedneſs of Mind, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97801:27"/>
with Joy and Triumph, to reſign up his innocent Breath, Praying for his Enemies and Perſecutors, and bleſſing the very Hand which is the Author of his Ruine: This muſt needs make us applaud our Felicity in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to ſuch a Religion, which can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch bleſſed and admirable Effects, to deſpiſe all the little Arts of vain Philoſophy, and to think the Rules thereof very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and inſufficient, which the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients in it could little benefit by, but would leave the great Maſter himſelf often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Proud and Revengeful, Ambitious and Luxurious, after all his mighty Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt Vice, and his Panegyricks upon Vertue</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But more eſpecially when we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the end of our Hopes, our eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is promiſed to us in another World; this is the moſt powerful Motive of all to this magnanimous Contempt of the World which we are ſpeaking of. If Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy only could in a great meaſure effect this, which did propoſe no other Happineſs but the Excellency and Reward of Vertue it ſelf, and the Satisfaction it bred in a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mind: How ought our Souls to be tranſported and raiſed above themſelves, and to think all things elſe nothing, when we conſider the Vaſtneſs and Immenſeneſs of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97801:28"/>
thoſe Joys? Indeed ſome Men have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by their Notions to leſſen this Valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Joys in another World, and have much ſlackned Mens Endeavours after this unexpreſſible Happineſs, by aſſerting that it is too ſelfiſh a thing, to propound our being Happy hereafter, as the greateſt Motive of our Obedience; but that it is the only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Rule to propoſe the Glory of God as the ultimate end of all our Actions. Nay, ſome have run ſo far, as to ſay, that Men ſtand obliged to glorifie God by their own endleſs Deſtruction, and that when they are predeſtinated to everlaſting Miſery, they ought not to repine, becauſe God's Glory is manifeſted thereby. But this is a moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Miſtake, than which, nothing can be more reflecting upon the Goodneſs of God, and more prejudicial to true Piety. For ſuch Texts of Scripture as theſe, <hi>Do all to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>that God in all things may be glorified,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. do not make God's Glory a diſtinct thing from our own Happineſs, but are ſo far from engaging us, to the glorifying of God, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whether it be by our Happineſs or Miſery, that we are to make our own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs the end of all our Actions; becauſe God is moſt Glorified by the Happineſs of his Creatures. For to fancy that God Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97801:28"/>
us only to Glorifie and Praiſe him would be a far greater Abſurdity, and would rather make God Almighty a <hi>Selfiſh</hi> Being, to Create us only for his own Ends, to ſing Halleluja's, and reflect his own Praiſes to him to all Eternity. This would be to impure the greateſt Vanity imaginable to the Beſt and Wiſeſt Being; but if we would think reaſonably, and as we ought to do of God, we muſt think that he created us on purpoſe to do us Good, that he has implanted in us a Faculty, to deſire above all things our own Happineſs, and when we do attain that, God's Glory is thereby the moſt manifeſted. So that 'tis all one, whether we deſire God's Glory, or our own Happineſs, becauſe God's Glory is ſhown in our being Happy.</p>
                  <p>But though we have all theſe Motives to raiſe in us this Magnanimity or Greatneſs of Soul, which a true Chriſtian ought to have, yet we muſt take Care, whilſt we are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of this, that we do not fall into <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Pride:</hi> For to Pride our ſelves in thoſe Free Graces which God had given us, to impute them to our own Power and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and to deſpiſe others, to whom God's Holy Spirit has been more ſparing in his Influences, is ſo far from a true Chriſtian Magnanimity, that it is a certain ſign of a little and a narrow Soul. This is ſo far from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97801:29"/>
being a Chriſtian Vertue, that it is the moſt Deviliſh Vice a Man can commit. It is the true and proper Sin of the Devil; for it was that which did principally occaſion his Fall. But we muſt let this Vertue of ours appear by retaining the Greateſt and Nobleſt Thoughts of God we poſſibly can, by truly conſidering the Excellency of our Religion, and the Gloriouſneſs of its Rewards, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon the Nobleneſs of our Nature, and the Turpitude of Sin; by thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Hatred to Vice, and his great Deſire to have us like him; by weighing the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Calling, and the ineſtimable Price of our Redemption; and then bravely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve never to do any thing unbecoming thoſe, to whom God has vouchſafed ſo much Favour, never by a baſe Ingratitude to offend ſo great a Benefactor.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That a Contempt of the World does conſiſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Content.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A True Contempt of the World doth conſiſt in arriving to a due Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in whatſoever State of Life God ſhall think fit to place us. I do not take Content here in its largeſt Extent, ſo as to include
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97801:29"/>
ſuch an univerſal Chearfulneſs of Mind, and ready Compliance with the Divine Pleaſure, as to be content with the good things we enjoy, and withal, patient under the Pains and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities we ſuffer. But I ſhall reſtrain the Word to its narrower and more common ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, by which we underſtand, <hi>ſuch an Indifferency towards the State of Life we are to go through here, as not to be over concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Poſſeſſion of Riches, whether we have them or have them not.</hi> For as for that part of Contentedneſs, which is converſant about the bearing of Pain, Sickneſs, or other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, I ſhall diſcourſe of that under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Head, <hi>viz. Of Patience.</hi> Now it is plain, than no Man can be ſaid to deſpiſe the World, that has an inordinate Deſire for the Riches of it, that will not ſuffer himſelf to enjoy theſe Comforts which God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, by his impatient longing for more; that has ſuch a hankering after the little Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles of this World, Lands, Moneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he durſt not truſt Providence with the Diſpoſal of them, but will himſelf endeavour after them by unjuſt Means and Artifices, and diſtract himſelf with thoughts of enjoying them for the future, at the Expence of his preſent Quiet and Satisfaction. Now this muſt be ſo far from deſpiſing the World, that it is a perfect Idolizing of it; for as the Apoſtle teaches,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97801:30"/>
                     <hi>Covetouſneſs is Idolatry;</hi> and it is all one to let <hi>our Knees bow to</hi> Baal <hi>or</hi> Aſtaroth, or to <hi>ſay to Gold, thou art my Hope; or to fine Gold, thou art my Confidence,</hi> Job 31.24. Therefore he that would arrive at a true Contempt of the World muſt take care,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Not to truſt in Riches.</note>1. <hi>Not to put his Truſt and Confidence in the Riches which God has beſtowed upon him.</hi> This is the Advice of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this World, that they truſt not in uncertain Riches.</hi> I believe there are few Men in the World, who will own this Charge, becauſe 'tis ſo eaſiy to be convinced of the contrary; they know Ten thouſand Pounds a Year will no ſooner ſecure a Man from the Grave, than Ten Pounds; and that a Lord has no better Title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven than a Beggar. They know that Riches will of themſelves cure no Diſeaſe, though they may breed a Thouſand; and that a Bag of Gold will afford no more Eaſe in a Fit of the Gout, than a Sack of Chaff. But yet it ſo happens for all this, that when Men are arrived to a great Degree of Wealth, they act as if their Money could do every thing, as if it could not only purchaſe them Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Honor, but even Immortality. For if ſuch Men did not really truſt in their Riches, Why ſhould they neglect all the true Means of their future Happineſs to acquire
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97801:30"/>
theſe? Why ſhould they beggar their Souls to improve their Eſtates? Why ſhould they neglect God's Worſhip, and violate his Laws? Why ſhould they defraud their Neighbour, nay, even their own Backs and Bellies, to gain an immeaſurable quantity of their belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Riches? If they did not really truſt in theſe, Why ſhould they behave themſelves with that inſupportable Haughtineſs to Men of lower Fortunes; to look upon Men of little or no Eſtates, only as the Cattle or Vermine of the World, and to treat them as their Slaves and Vaſſals? For ſuch a Temper as this is as far from a <hi>Contempt of the World,</hi> as Epicuriſm is from Abſtemiouſneſs and Mortification; and as inconſiſtent with it, as the true Worſhip of God is with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Mammon.</hi> We ought, in Order to this Vertue, to look upon our Riches only as our <hi>Viaticum,</hi> to ſuſtain us in our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to another World; to be very indifferent whether our Fare be ſo very much, or ſo very delicious or no, we need only take care that it be but enough to bring us thither. We muſt conſider, that 'tis but a little time we can enjoy them, and therefore 'tis not worth ones while to ſet ones Heart upon that which we muſt ſo ſhortly part with; but that we ought rather to leave them with the ſame Readineſs as a Man puts off his Riding

We ſee how ſadly that poor Wretch was diſappointed, who had other Thoughts of theſe things. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thou haſt much Goods laid up for many years, take thy Eaſe, Eat, Drink, and be Merry.</hi> He thought he was like to have a glorious time of it, he found he had Health to enjoy his Pleaſures, and Pleaſures to gratifie his Appetite; he fancied he could not Wiſh faſter than he could Enjoy, and that his <hi>Full Barns</hi> would never leave his Deſires empty But alas! this jolly Scene of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination was quickly over-clouded by a Melancholly Meſſage, <hi>Thou Fool, this Night ſhall Soul be required of thee, Ver.</hi> 20. The grim Aſpect of the King of Terrors made his Thoughts a little more ſerious and rational, and put him in mind, that when he depended ſo much upon his Wealth, he did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Accidents which might ſupervene. Indeed the Scripture may very well call this Man Fool, for this fond Preſumption of Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enjoy his Goods; but this Man would have enjoyed his Goods if he had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was ſome ſmall Degree of Wiſdom; but as for thoſe who yet depend upon their Riches, and yet never can have the Heart to enjoy them, they do much better, I am ſure, deſerve that Compellation.</p>

They live well and happy enough at preſent, and find they have an Affluence of every thing that is good and comfortable; but they are ſo diſtracted for fear they ſhould be deprived of theſe Comforts, that whileſt they have them, they are never able to enjoy them. They are ſtartled at every unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Accident, for fear it ſhould contribute to their Detriment; they are ſo fu l of diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caution in every thing they do, leſt they ſhould by any ways be circumvented or outwitted; they can never ſleep without having taken a View of that which is almoſt impoſſible to be miſſing, and are apt to frame the Noiſe even of innocent Vermine into the Trampling of Aſſaſſins and Robbers. Now though theſe unhappy Men do enjoy little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the World, yet they are very far from a Contempt of it; they have a great Love and Hankering after it, but put off the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment ſo from time to time, till they are dropt into the Grave without ever taſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of its Pleaſures.

For although we had never ſo much reaſon to ſuſpect our future Condition to be good, yet it would be very fooliſh to let our Cares for the Future to ſpoil all our Enjoyments for the preſent, becauſe this would make our Life all of a piece, and ſet our flouriſhing Condition on a Level with our Unfortunate; this would be to anticipate our Miſery, and make us feel more in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination beforehand, than in Experience when it comes.

We ſhould not think that Man in a much better Condition, who ſhould grieve as much for the Loſs of a Horſe, as for the Death of his Son and Heir.

I do not commend <hi>Crates</hi> for a Man of great Reaſon, for tumbling all his Wealth into the Sea himſelf; but I think that Man has leſs, who by exceſſive Grief for a Loſs at Sea, will venture growing Mad for it.

Sometimes one Loſs is compenſated with a greater Gain, which otherways would have been impoſſible; it may put Men upon new, and more ſucceſsful Projects, improve their Caution for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and double their Diligence. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Zeno</hi> got his Philoſophical Knowledge by a Shipwrack of all he had; for he was (as he reported) by that Accident, drove into the Harbor of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which was (ſays he) a very proſperous Voyage. A Man's Loſs ſometimes may prove for his Eaſe and Quiet, his Eſtate might before have been too cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome, and have bred him more Torment than Satisfaction, which is moſt certainly ſo in all Men, who love Quiet and Retirement. Poor <hi>Anacreon,</hi> when <hi>Polycrates</hi> had given him Five Talents, he being a Poet, and not uſed much to Money, could not ſleep for two whole Nights together, for thinking how to lock it up, or how to place it out ſafely; and thus, growing quickly weary of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer's Trade, comes Back to his Benefactor,

and deſires him to take his Gift again, for it coſt him more Care to keep it than it was worth. But we Chriſtians have rather reaſon to bleſs God, for delivering us from a great deal of our Incumbrance; that he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged us of ſome part of our Stewardſhip; that by leaving us leſs, he has left our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the eaſier to be made up.

And this Temper is as unreaſonable as the foregoing one, becauſe by this they

There is no Condition in this World ſo valuable, as to grieve a Wiſe Man, becauſe he does not enjoy it, and there is no Condition ſo miſerable, but he may find enough Satisfaction of in it, to keep him from Repining and Grudging at other Mens Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. He conſiders that the World is but a great Stage for Men to act their Parts in, and what cares he which Part comes to his Lot; for he knows if he acts the Peaſant or the Beggar, he may have as much Applauſe, and as great a Reward as by Perſonating an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. He conſiders that he ought in Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to thank God for the preſent Things he doth enjoy; but 'tis the greateſt Impudence to quarrel with him, becauſe he does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him more, when he had not the leaſt Pretence to what he has afforded him alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He thinks rather how miſerable he ſhould have been, had he wanted the good Things now in his Poſſeſſion; not how happy he ſhould be in acquiring others. And this truly is enough to keep the Poor Man from Murmuring: He enjoys not only Life and Being, and other the more univerſal Benefits
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97801:35"/>
of Providence, but Health, Security, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Enjoyments, which Rich Men en-the Poor Man enjoys, or would part with all vyat, and ſometimes. A great Eſtate will not make a Man live longer than a ſmall one; nay, where one has been ſtarved to Death with not having enough to ſubſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Ten thouſand have killed themſelves, and ſhortned their Days by Surfeiting upon too much. The Sun ſhines as gloriouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cottage as the Palace, and the Moon lends as bright a Ray to the Poor Man's Cart, as to the King's Coach. The Rains beſtow as fatning a Moiſture upon the poor Alms-man's little Plot, as upon the Gardens of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and the Winds breath as delicious Breezes upon the Travelling Beggar, as upon the Triumphing Monarch. Theſe are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and common Benefits of Poverty, which make it not to be deſpiſed and undervalued; but there are others which make it to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wiſhed for, and envied at. What would the crazy Voluptuary give for the poor Man's Athletick Conſtitution? though he rolls upon a Bed of Down, What would he give for the <hi>Sleeep of the Labouring Man,</hi> which is <hi>ſweet, whether he eat little or much?</hi> Eccl. 5.10. What would he part with for his Edge of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, that makes his ſavory Food go down with ſuch a Guſt and Reliſh, as gives him
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97801:35"/>
more Satisfaction than the other receives from all his Studied Delicacies? How would he, who has run through half the Diſeaſes of the Bills of Mortality, be willing to change Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with him who hardly ever knows a Diſeaſe, until it carries him thither, where he is like to know no more? I am confident many a Rich and Powerful Favorite in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts (who ſeemed to Men of mean E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate the greateſt Object of Envy) when he has found himſelf falling into Diſgrace, and tumbling downwards faſter than he aſcended, when he has been ſurrounded with Dangers and Accuſations from his Adverſaries; ſuch a great Man has thought the pooreſt Tenant in any of his Mannors, to be a happier Man than he; that could live without Danger from malicious Enemies, and the Practices of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining Adverſaries. For the Poor Man has no need to fear any of theſe frightful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, which are ſo wont to terrifie the Rich. Let what will Convulſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of State happen, he is ſure he is low enough to have all thoſe Storms paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Head; he is not in fear of loſing that which is worth no ones taking up; he knows that it is only the Wealth and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Rich that muſt glut the Victor's Avarice. And truly this one Conſideration makes the Poor Man alone hearty and cheary,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97801:36"/>
when all other Mens Faces are clouded with Fears and Diſtractions. I do not urge this to prove that Poverty is the happieſt Condition of Life, or to make Men eſpouſe a Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Poverty; but only to ſhew that God has ſo tempered the Conditions of Life, that in the meaneſt State of it, we may find many things, which not only may keep us from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, but which may be improved to a conſiderable Degree of Happineſs.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Nor deſire the greateſt Plenty.</note>5. To come up to a Contempt of the World, <hi>We ought not eagerly to deſire Great Riches:</hi> For ſuch Men are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Slaves and Vaſſals of it, that are always digging in its Mines, who are ſtill Sweating and Toiling for that Oar which others muſt at laſt enjoy. Now it is not every endeavouring to raiſe an Eſtate which is thus reprehenſible; but only ſuch an impetuous Deſire, and ſuch an unintermitted Purſuit after Riches, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us indiſpoſed and uncapable to perform our other Duties which are incumbent upon us. I doubt not but that a Man whom God has placed in a ſucceſsful way of Thriving, may as lawfully improve his Eſtate, as he may enlarge his Houſe or Garden: For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Purchaſing Eſtates was allowed as a Reward to Vertue and Induſtry, all the Riches and good Things which the World affords, would always run in one Channel, and ſerve
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97801:36"/>
only to pamper, it may be, the fooliſh and lazy Progeny of ſome few wealthy Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, who have entailed Money upon them without Senſe or Honeſty; whileſt all the brave Men that have defended their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Country, and have inſtructed the World by uſeful Inventions, by noble and profitable Sciences, muſt be for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Feed upon the Crumbs which fall from their Table, and be always content to ſubſiſt upon the Parings of their Eſtates. All the Fault lies, when Men make the Getting of Money their chiefeſt Aim; when their Thoughts are ſet upon nothing elſe; when they ſacrifice all their other Intereſts, their Credit and Reputation, their Bodies and Souls, only to obtain a great Eſtate; when they neglect the Worſhip of God for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Mammon;</hi> when they are cruel and unmerciful, and ſuffer the Chink of their Money to drown the Cry of the Poor. I diſtinguiſh here the Covetous Man from the Oppreſſor, who raiſes an Eſtate by Wrong and Robbery, by Cheating Orphans and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and other leſs circumſpect People; for a Man may be wicked enough of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in raiſing an Eſtate, and yet never be guilty of what we generally call Diſhoneſty or Knavery. For that earthlineſs of Mind, that Sordidneſs or Temper, that unmerciful
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97801:37"/>
Bowelleſs Diſpoſition of Soul, that Defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Poor of thoſe good Things which are depoſited in their Hands as Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards for them, that Idolizing of Riches, that Neglect of Religion, and Contempt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Things will to all Intents and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as effectually Damn a Man, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groſſer Acts of Fraud and Injuſtice. I obſerve there are two ſorts of Perſons called Fools in Scripture, the Atheiſt, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Man; the one, becauſe in Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to all Experience, he believes no God at all; and the other, becauſe he has made the ſillieſt Choice of a God imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, has placed for the Object of his Worſhip a little ſenſleſs periſhing Money. I ſhall not now diſpute the Point which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fool of the two; but however, one would think that the Atheiſt doth bid fairer for Senſe, who would rather own no God at all, than ſuch a vile and contemptible one as the Covetous Man worſhips. And indeed, if we except Swearing, there is not a more unreaſonable Sin in the World than Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is; becauſe a Man propoſes no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and accountable end in following that Vice. He takes up with other Vices, in hopes to enjoy the Satisfaction of them; but Covetouſneſs can never endure to hear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing as Enjoyment; for to enjoy an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97801:37"/>
Eſtate, to ſuch a Man, is as great a Grief, as not to have it; he ſpends all his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in Sweat and Toil, and undergoes all the Care and Trouble of Riches, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe after him may enjoy the Pleaſure of them; which made one ſay very well,<note place="margin">Publius Syrus Avarus ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil rectë fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit niſi cum moritur.</note> 
                     <hi>That a Covetous Man does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well but when he dies.</hi> Other Vices are quiet and ſtill when they are gratified; but this cries out for more, the more you give it. When a Man has got Ten thouſand Pound by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, he is more Covetous than when he was worth but One hundred Pound; for ſuch a ones Deſire is only his Diſeaſe, and therefore the Covetous Man is compared to one in a Dropſie; for the greateſt Acceſſions which he can hope for, will be ſo far from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying him, that they tend to nothing elſe, but only to augment his Thirſt. But let ſuch a one conſider how this Vice doth expoſe him to the Scorn of all ſenſible Men, for acting ſo contrary to all Senſe and Reaſon, by thus ſtarving himſelf, only to Pamper he knows not who after him. Let a Man's Eſtate be either great or ſmall, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is the fooliſheſt Project a Man can take up with. If a Man be Poor, when he is reſolved for Covetouſneſs, that will not mend his Condition, but will keep him Poor
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97801:38"/>
ſtill; he may in time, 'tis true, get more Baggs into his Coffer, but will be no better for them, than if he ſtill was not worth one Farthing. But if a Man be Rich, and yet be Covetous, it is as unnatural, as to Eat when a Man's Belly is full already; he may lay on a greater Load, but he cannot digeſt it, and it will be ſo far from Nouriſhing him, that it will ſerve only to make him Sick: For men are much miſtaken if they think Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs does conſiſt in having a great Eſtate, though they had a Heart to uſe it, as few Covetous Men have; for all that Men of the moſt exorbitant Revenues can enjoy, is felt with greater Pleaſure by a Man of but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Fortune: Such a one is array'd decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Cloths that are better apt to defend him from the Injuries of the Weather, and yet not make him walk abroad in fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Robb'd. He has enough about him to perform all uſeful and neceſſary Offices, and is not troubled with a multitude of unruly Servants, who generally give a Man more Vexation than they do him Service, and has his Work better done by thoſe few he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, than by a great many, who ſhift their Duty off from one to another, and at laſt leave it undone. He has five times more Freedom with that his Mediocrity, than the others have with all their Greatneſs; whoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97801:38"/>
pompous Equipage is only a Clog to them; for a Man had as good go abroad with a Keeper as with a multitude of Attendants; becauſe ſuch an one is a Priſoner within his own Houſe, till his Servants are ready to conduct him out. His Table is furniſhed with ſufficient, and more wholeſome Food, and his time of Eating is more at his own Command, tho' the other may have the Advantage of being oftner ſurfeited, and making his Stomach ſtay for the Solemnity of his Entertainment. And upon this Account it was that <hi>Ariſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> the Philoſopher, handſomly compared a great Eſtate to a Pair of Shoes which are too big, that can ſerve to no other purpoſe but to make a Man ſtumble. For certainly a wiſe Man would rather deſire a Fortune that would juſt fit him, than ſuch a large one which is more cumberſome than convenient. Now for theſe Reaſons, Covetouſneſs would be an unaccountable thing, though a Man ſhould purchaſe a great Eſtate by it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it when he had done; but not one cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Man in Five thouſand is ſo wiſe as to enjoy what he has got; he ſtill keeps his Belly lank, that his Baggs may ſwell, and puniſhes his own Body, to pamper his Heirs. Such an one <hi>Solomon</hi> well deſcribes, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6.2. <hi>A Man to whom God has given Riches, Wealth, and Honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing for his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97801:39"/>
Soul of all that he deſireth, yet God giveth him, not Power to eat thereof.</hi> He ſtarves in the midſt of his Affluence, heaps up Riches ſo long, till he is really Poor, and as if he was running backwards in a Ring, he flies from <hi>Poverty</hi> ſo far back, till he runs upon that which he firſt avoided.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, Why ſhould Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs be ſo foul a Crime, it does no harm to any Body elſe, a Man thereby only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears thoſe things which he might enjoy, which is an Injury to no one but himſelf; beſides, Prudence engages us to take care for the future; and the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He that provides not for thoſe of his own Houſe, is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. That a Man ought not to tyrannize over his own Body, any more than he ought to murther himſelf; as he has not ſuch a Power over himſelf, as to deſtroy his Body, ſo neither ought he to defraud it of thoſe Neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments which God has ordered us to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; unleſs it be upon a Religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in order to ſubject it the better to the Soul. Therefore he that Starves his Belly to increaſe his Eſtate, is in a leſſer degree <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> he feloniouſly robs his Body of thoſe Enjoyments which our bountiful Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator has provided for it. 2. The Covetous Man injures the Publick, either in letting that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97801:39"/>
Money lye uſeleſs by, which ought to be current for the Benefit of the Community, or by a penurious way of Living, which no ways contribute to the Circulation of Trade, which is the Sinews of all Society, and the Livelihood of the far greater Part of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; by generally oppreſſing the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous with extravagant Uſe and extortive Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Or <hi>Laſtly,</hi> By defrauding other Poor Men of the Alms and Benefactions they have a Title to. 3. Neither ought we to be ſo ſollicitous for the Future, as not to enjoy the Preſent. We ought to commit all future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to God's Diſpoſal, who will provide for us as is moſt fit. He who could feed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with Bread from Heaven, and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> by Ravens, will moſt certainly never let us want what is fitting for us.

But I ſhall take it in that Senſe, which <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the Third Book of his <hi>Ethicks</hi> doth, where he defines Temperance to be a <hi>Mediocrity about the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Body,</hi> that is, <hi>a moderate Uſe of them.</hi> So that a Man may be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure intemperate by immoderate uſing any of theſe Pleaſures, which are convey'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Senſes; by an extravagant Delight in hearing Muſick, by looking upon fine Proſpects and Pictures, and by ſmelling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Perfumes, as well as by Whoring or Drinking. But becauſe the two other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are more ſtrong and untamable, they meet with more Occaſions, and have more violent Temptations to invite Men to their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; 'tis the Buſineſs chiefly of Temperance, to moderate the Uſe of Pleaſures ariſing from them. In the Moderation therefore of theſe Pleaſures, Temperance becomes a threefold Vertue, and branches it ſelf into,

preſent Caſe; the Bounds of Temperance in different Men are different; one Man of a very Hail Conſtitution, whoſe Blood moves on rapidly in his Veins, and does daily boil off a great Part of its ſelf by its agil Motion, or one whoſe Labour does weary him by continual Conſumption of his Spirits, hath greater need of a Supply from a larger quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Nouriſhment; than the cold Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, whoſe Pulſe hardly creeps within him, or thoſe unactive or idle People, who ſcarce ever ſtir all the Week from their Bed or their Chair.

All Vices are really ſcandalous and reproachful, or at leaſt ought to be ſo; but this appears to all Men, to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of Uglineſs than the reſt: for many Men have arrived to ſuch an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Vice, to ſuch a <hi>Glorying in their Shame,</hi> that they have openly avowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of <hi>Whordom</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs, Murther</hi> and <hi>Revenge;</hi> but I never yet knew a Man that had Face enough to profeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Glutton.</hi> This is a Vice ſo perfectly Brutiſh, that a Man not only diſparages, but even dethrones his Reaſon in ſubmitting to it, by putting that Noble Faculty upon ſuch vile Offices, as being a Slave and a Pander to his Belly. Many other Vices will ſuffer Men to proſecute their Calling and them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they may be very Vitious, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all very Induſtrious; but this Vice nails down their Hands to their Pockets, makes <hi>Work</hi> as uncomfortable to them as <hi>Faſting;</hi> it makes their Buſineſs go on with that ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and heavineſs, as if every Motion of

their Hand went to their very Heart; they have learned to Labour ſo much at their Meat, that they Freeze at their Work. I might add, that this Vice does incapacitate Men from all Acts of Prayer and Devotion, and all other Religious Exerciſes; it fills the Soul with Carnal Idea's, makes every thing of a Spiritual Nature as eaſie to be ſeen by their Eyes as their Underſtanding; the Fumes from their Stomach do ſo overcloud their Brain, that they would quickly flag the Wings of their Devotion, whenever they ſhould attempt it; nor can we well ſuppoſe that thoſe refined Thoughts of Prayer and Contemplation ſhould be ever found in ſuch Minds which are hardly able to think at all But I need not much urge this to thoſe that can condeſcend to ſo filthy and ſo beaſtly a Sin; for they know but little what Devotion is, or concern themſelves but little about it. But however, ſuch Men may conſider laſtly, that <hi>Health</hi> is a thing worthy their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that a Man ſhould not eat too much becauſe he ſhould not be Sick too often: that their Exceſs of Eating will in time dull the edge of their Appetite; that it will be the Parent of many Diſeaſes, which will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much leſſen their beloved Pleaſure, or will bring on Death, which will make it ceaſe to be at all; that it is better for them to be

thrifty of their darling Enjoyment only to make it hold out the longer; that it is but an ill Bargain to linger out an Old Age in the Extremities of the Gout or Chollick, for a few Surfeiting Meals when they are young; or for the ſake of this ugly piece of Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to loſe Twenty or Thirty Years out of their Life.</p>

Who can, without Indignation, as at an Affront offered to Human Nature, read of ſuch Wretches as <hi>Caligula, Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> to find them ſending Senators into the Eaſt to fetch home Fiſh and Fowl, and calling a Senate to conſult how to diſh out a great Fiſh; to ſee them rolling in Baths of flowing Nard, diſſolving Jewels worth a Million of our Money, and drinking them off to a Whores Health? I cannot ſay we have any ſo Luxurious in our Time, becauſe we have none that are Maſters of ſo great Riches; but if we may make an Eſtimate of what they would do in ſuch a Fortune, from the Vanity they ſhew in their preſent one, I

But the Uſe of this Duty to all pious Chriſtians is unſpeakable. It ſerves to calm our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they grow fiery and untameable; it curbs our Affections, and makes them ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily manageable when they would be extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reins from us; it makes our Minds quiet and ſedate, clear and perceptive, and apt for Contemplation and Spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; it improves our Zeal, and animates our Petitions, ſets our Souls upon the Flight,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97801:46"/>
and makes our Devotions all Life, and Wing and Spirit. Ask but the devout Chriſtian what difference he finds between his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Devotions, and thoſe upon his Days of Faſting and Humiliation, and he will tell you as much as between Life and Death, between a Body and a Carcaſe: There is ſo much Warmth, and Vigor, and Alacrity in the one, and ſo much Coldneſs and Lumpiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the other; which muſt make all good Men lament, as a ſign of the Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of this Age, that this Duty of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo ſtrangely neglected; when the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faſts, which are backed with particular Authority, are obſerved for the moſt part out of Fear only; when the Weekly Faſts of the Church, and the others at the more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Times, by the far greateſt part of the Nation, are not in the leaſt diſtinguiſhed from other Days; and by moſt of the reſt by only Eating a Diſh of Fiſh upon them. For this Reaſon, I am ſure the Papiſts, who make no very good Uſe of Faſting neither, do very much, and not without ſome Reaſon, exclaim againſt us of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for ſuch an horrible Neglect of ſo Chriſtian a Duty.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97801:47"/>
they all loſt their Senſes.</hi> And indeed it would make any one wonder what Charms there ſhould be in Drunkenneſs, that ſhould recommend it ſo much to the World. When we conſider what Fools and Sots it makes of Men, to be the Sport of their own Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the Diverſion of the Children in the Streets; that it makes them ſick after every Debauch, and breaks their Conſtitution af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many; that it diſcloſes their Secrets, and makes them often for ever repent of what they then diſcover; that it animates Men into Quarrels, arms them with Rage and Fury, and oftentimes makes the deareſt Friends Murtherers to one another; that it fooliſhly ſquanders away a Man's Time, makes him loſe his Trade, or neglect his Buſineſs; that it oftentimes Beggars his Family, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifies his Senſes, and at laſt damns his Soul: I ſay, to conſider all this, a Man may be as ſoon in Love with Halters and Gibbets, with Daggers and Poiſon, as with ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minable and peſtilential a Vice. I know 'tis uſually ſaid that good Company puts them upon it, for no Man will own to be Drunk for the Pleaſure of Drinking. But why ſhould Company make a Man Drink to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs more than to Eat to exceſs? Why ſhould not I be obliged to eat Slices of Beef with a Man of a bigger Stomach, as well as to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97801:47"/>
drink the ſame Quantity with a Man of a ſtronger Head? Is a Man ever the better Company for being Drunk? Nay, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, does not one drunken Man ſpoil a great deal of good Company? A Man indeed may talk with more Noiſe, but never with more Wit for being Drunk; and if ever a good Thing be ſaid in a Company of Dunkards, it is whilſt they be yet Sober. 'Tis Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe to ſay we cannot be ſo Rude to part with our Company, for it is time to part with them who have reſolved to part with all Sobriety and good Senſe. Beſides the Civility of the Age will hardly allow Men to lay too great a Reſtraint upon any one; and let a Man but eſtabliſh himſelf a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Sobriety, and the very Awe of his Vertue will keep the moſt impudent Drunkard from being too preſſing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate: ſo that in ſhort, no Man can be obliged to be Drunk, unleſs he has a Mind to be ſo; and that is a thing ſo horrible ſcandalous, that few Men will care to own, and therefore I am ſure no Man ought to practiſe.</p>

The Scripture pronounces a Woe, not only againſt thoſe that are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Drunk, but againſt <hi>them, that are mighty to drink Wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong Drink,</hi> Iſa. 5.22. As for the Drunkards of the ſhallower Head, by their Sickneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Debauch, and the Shame of it, they are kept from Drinking altogether ſo often; but the Triumphant Drunkard has no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon him, for his conſtant Succeſſes do animate and encourage him continually on to freſh Conqueſts. Indeed Drunkards of all ſorts are equal in their Crime, as to their fooliſh laviſhing away their Time, and ſpoiling God's Creatures, as to their waſtfully ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Money, and neglecting their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the ſtrongheaded Drunkard is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the more Vicious, becauſe he has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated all Modeſty from his Vice, he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in that which others are aſhamed of, and has taken up the Office of being the Devil's Vice-Gerent, by firſt tempting Men to ſin, and afterwards expoſing them to ſhame.</p>

                        <hi>That a Man ſhould not ſpend too much Time in Drinking.</hi> Whenever Drinking is allowable, beſides, when we are adry, it is only for an innocent Recreation or Refreſhment, when we are tired with Buſineſs, or have not much Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do. And this cannot be for any long time, for either our Devotion, or Study, or Buſineſs, or Sleep, or ſomething elſe will call us from it. But to turn this Recreation into an Employ, to take up our Sitting in a Company as if we were to get our Livelihood in it, is to contradict the ſtanding Rules and Purpoſes of God's Providence; 'tis to ſet out our Time deſignedly for Drinking, and to do our Buſineſs by the By. I confeſs I have often heartily pitied the Misfortune of ſome Gentlemen of an illiterate Education, who can as ſoon ſpend an Afternoon without Breathing as without Drinking, for that is the beſt Expedient they think they can find to help off with their Time, which hangs ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably upon their Hands. Indeed theſe poor Gentlemen have reaſon almoſt to curſe their Parents, that would give them no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Education, whereby they can find no Reliſh in thoſe noble Arts and Sciences, which makes the Lives of other Learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men paſs ſo pleaſantly along: But however, no Gentleman can be ſo ſtraitly put to it for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97801:49"/>
Diverſion, as to be forced upon Drinking for it; for when it is dry enough to be abroad, the Sports in the Field will give him an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment more delightful and more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and at other times we have Books enough in our own Tongue, in Divinity and Hiſtory, Law and Morality, to ſpend a Day with Delight and Improvement; nay, even to take up with the frothy Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Plays and Romances, or every day to Card and Chat with the Ladies, is time better ſpent than to be a Drinking.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Nor at ill Hours.</note>Fourthly, <hi>That a Man ſhould not be Drinking at unſeaſonable Hours.</hi> The Night is a time which Nature has ſet aſide for Reſt and Sleep; and when every thing about us in the dead of Night is huſht and ſtill, methinks 'tis extreamly unnatural to hear the Noiſe and Mirth of Jolly Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the day time Nature ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with us, with a Face of Gaiety and Delight, and the ſight of People ſtirring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, ſeems to add ſomething more of Life to our Pleaſure; but in the Night time, Mens Voices ſeem to have a different Tone and Accent; the Time of Night ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to mix ſomething of a Melancholineſs with the Mirth, as if one was hearing Stories among the Tombs. Therefore I wonder how
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97801:49"/>
it ſhould come in faſhion, in downright De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight to the Order of Nature, to ſit up Drinking ſo late a Nights, when they may find ſo much more convenient and pleaſanter a time for it in the Day. Nay, Drinking to Exceſs in the Day-time is not more Injurious to the Body than the bare ſitting up long in the Night; for the Want of Sleep only, and the Chill of the Air are as miſchievous as the Intemperance; ſo that for this Reaſon thoſe that are reſolved to ſet up for Drinking, ſhould, methinks, take always their Doſe in the Day-time, that ſo they may be able to hold out their Trade the longer. Add to this the Trouble and Diſturbance which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Servants and Attendants (to whom a certain Regard is due) and oftentimes to whole Families; and this will be a Motive to a good natured Man to find out ſome ſitter Opportunities to drink in.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>That he ſhould not ſpend too much Money in Drinking.</hi> Many a Man has been ruined in the World, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by keeping a drunken Company, but one that has been too expenſive for him. For, one Man can afford to ſpend more upon his Diverſion than will keep another Man's Family; ſo that if an ordinary Mechanick will keep Company with none but Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97801:50"/>
and Merchants, 'tis ten to one but he ſtarves his Family by only paying his Club with them, who yet may never drink to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs all the while. For every poor Man cannot pretend to thoſe more generous Drinks, which may be well enough afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Perſons of better Quality; the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them may be no Detriment to their Families, whilſt the other Man's Children may pine for <hi>Bread</hi> as he is drinking <hi>Wine.</hi> Now ſuch a Man ought to conſider, that his <hi>Diverſion</hi> is the laſt thing he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, that he ought to provide his Family of <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> before he allows himſelf thoſe <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,</hi> and that his pleading that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drinks to exceſs will not in the leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone for his Inhumanity and Barbarity to his poor Family. And, perhaps, more Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, of late, in the Nation, have been ruined by this affectatious Vanity, than by down right Debauchery; ſince Men of all Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties almoſt have endeavoured to live alike, ſince every little Man is ambitious of keep- the beſt Company, out of hopes of getting ſome conſiderable Character and Reputation by it, although by all ſenſible Men of their own Cabal, he is lookt upon but as a bold and oſtentatious Fellow, and is adjudged by God Almighty for not <hi>providing for thoſe of his own Houſe, to be worſe than an Infidel.</hi>

But then this State is to be a State of Virginity indeed, not only of Celibacy, as the Papiſts generally make it; where, if the Parties keep from Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they may commit all the Whoredoms and Villanies in the World, and yet keep their Oath of Continency moſt ſtrenuouſly. Nay, to ſee how they abuſe the State of Virginity, with ſuch abominable Permiſſions and Diſpenſations, it would put a modeſt Heathen to the Bluſh.

Humor, no Sin at all; that the Pope can give a Licenſe to commit it; nay, that he has actually granted ſuch a Licenſe as is beyond what any Man, though never ſo wicked, would expect; for Pope <hi>Pius</hi> III. gave Leave to the Cardinal of St. <hi>Lucia</hi> and all his Family, to commit Sodomy all the three hot Months in the Year.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Fornication and all other Acts of Uncleanneſs are ſinful, becauſe they are an Undervaluing our Nature, the putting us upon the moſt ſhameful Practices, ſuch as no ſober Reaſon will allow; contrary to the Deſign and Purport of Nature, and to the unſpeakable Abuſe and Diſhonor both of Soul and Body. For our Bodies were given us by God Almighty to be ſerviceable to the Soul in all Spiritual and Rational Employments, and for the Conveyance of ſenſual Pleaſures, as far as may make for the Preſervation and

comfortable Subſiſtence of the Animal Life; but not to employ them to the vileſt purpoſes, not to make them a Drudge to our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Luſts and Deſires, and to ſerve to all the filthy ends of Beaſtlineſs and Senſuality. Nay, the Apoſtle carries on this Argument farther, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. where he bids us flee For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, becauſe <hi>our Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and therefore it is an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impiety, to profane with our wicked Luſts that Place, which is taken up for the Reſidence of the ever bleſſed Spirit. But then what a greater Diſhonor is it to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, thoſe pure Aethereal Subſtances, thoſe Angelick Natures, to conſent to ſuch vile Actions, contrary to all natural Law and Reaſon; to make them ſo undervalue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to neglect their own Intereſt and Happineſs?

Men betake themſelves to theſe unlawful Pleaſures, they grow very cold and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Comforts of a married Life, and take all Opportunities to deſpiſe it as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to their Pleaſures and natural Freedom. But this, at beſt, is but audaciouſly to break out from thoſe Fences, which God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has made about us, and to pretend to a Freedom which is inconſiſtent with our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and contrary to our Obedience. 'Tis to caſſate and make void God's Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to contemn and trample under foot, that Primitive Inſtitution, as old as our very State of Innocency; 'tis to invert the Order and Preſcript of Nature, to wreſt God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations out of his Hands, and to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Enjoyments upon their own Terms and Meaſures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis contrary to the expreſs Word of God. For ſetting aſide the Seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, where under Adultery all Sins of Uncleanneſs are forbidden, and the woful Denunciation againſt them in many Places of the Old Teſtament; our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.27. has improved the old Precept: <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery. But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever looketh on a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with her already in his Heart.</hi> Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97801:52"/>
all outward acts of Uncleanneſs are more diligently to be avoided, when the very thoughts and deſires of it are ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſinful. So the Apoſtle adviſes us, That we ſhould <hi>not faſhion our ſelves according to our former Luſts, but to be holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14. that we ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So St. <hi>Paul</hi> again, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3. bids us <hi>abſtain from Fornication, that every one of us ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel</hi> (i.e. his Body) <hi>in Honour.</hi> And he tells us further, that <hi>Fornicators ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God.</hi> From all which we may conclude, that, whatever the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines may further object, the Papiſts may as well make Murder or Inceſt to be venial Sins as Fornication; and as for the Popes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Indulgence for it, it will ſtand us in little ſtead, unleſs he could let a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven for that, for which God has plainly declared he will keep him out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But ſome object, That <hi>ſimple For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> is no ſin, becauſe it is not forbid in the Ten Commandments; for if it be a ſin, it is a ſin againſt our Neighbour, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the ſecond Table. But this is the conſent of two perſons voluntarily to an act, and then, <hi>volenti non fit injuria,</hi> they injure
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97801:53"/>
no body; and ſo conſequently, this can be no ſin againſt our Neighbour. To this may be anſwered, 1. That all Sins are not againſt God or our Neighbour, for there are ſome againſt a Man's own ſelf, as are all ſuch as are againſt the Dignity of our Nature, and the deſign of our Creation, as Drunkenneſs, immoderate Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are reducible to the ſecond Table, either as the Cauſes, Incentives, or leſſer Degrees of thoſe groſſer ſins which are there ſpecified. So Anger is reducible to Murder, becauſe it is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Parent of it; Drunkenneſs, and other Intemperance to Adultery, becauſe it is an Incentive of it; and ſo likewiſe Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and all other Uncleanneſs to the ſame Commandment, becauſe they are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſſer degrees of that Vice which is there prohibited. 2. But This Sin is a Sin againſt a Mans Neighbour as well as againſt himſelf; 'tis an injury to the Relations and Families of the Perſons thus abuſed; 'tis an injury to the Publick, by deſpiſing Legal Matrimony, and contributing to the Birth of Spurious Children; 'tis an injury to the Perſons of each other, by diſhonouring their Bodies, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and furthering them in the commiſſion of a known Sin.</p>

                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Others ſay, in favour of <hi>Fornication</hi> and other <hi>Uncleanneſſes,</hi> that they are things they cannot help; that their Temptations are ſo ſtrong upon them, that there is no reſiſting them; and let them uſe all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Arguments they can againſt them, yet ſtill they will prevail; and therefore 'tis as good, they think, to make no oppoſition at all, as to be ſure to be foiled in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. But to this I anſwer, That I hope when they ſay they cannot help it, they are not neceſſitated or forced to ſuch an action, for that is what we call a Rape; or that they are neceſſitated to them as they are to Eat or to Drink: All that they can mean by it is, That they have ſtrong inclinations to them, which will coſt them ſome trouble to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. But then, what is this to a Neceſſity? Is a Man neceſſitated to be ſtarved becauſe it will coſt him ſome pains to get a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? Is one forced to be a Slave to his Enemy, becauſe he muſt be at the Trouble of encountring him before he can get rid of him? Why, ſo it is in the caſe of our Luſts and Paſſions, we muſt ſtruggle and contend with them, Maſter and Subdue them, and not lazily ſuffer them to get the better of us, when with a little ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving we might get the better of them. 'Tis in vain to ſay we muſt as well ſubmit to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97801:54"/>
theſe <hi>Appetites</hi> as to thoſe other <hi>Deſires</hi> of <hi>Meat and Drink,</hi> for the fulfilling of thoſe is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of Nature, and without which a Man can hardly live a Day; but I dare ſay, no Man was ever ſtarved by Chaſtity. Yet after all, if the Man's Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are ſo untameable, as to render his Life uneaſie by the impulſe of continual Temptations, by the weakneſs of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and the weariſom employ of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Watching and Obſervance, then God himſelf has provided a Remedy for this, the Holy State of Matrimony; and if he refuſes to make uſe of this means, when he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin 'tis at his own Peril. I have been ſomething long in anſwering theſe two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, becauſe they are the topping ones of the Debauchees, by which they would excuſe their own Crimes, and betray others into the like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To be Chaſte is to preſerve the Marriage Bed undefiled.</hi> This is a Duty which has been accounted moſt Sacred and Inviolable in all Ages and Nations, and the breach of it was never accounted a matter of Mirth and Drollery but amongſt us Chriſtians, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, to our ſhames, profeſs a Religion which eſtabliſhes Matrimony upon a firmer Foundation than any. Diſagreement and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97801:54"/>
inequality of Temper or Age, are in other Religions cauſes ſufficient for Divorce; but our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever putteth away his Wife, ſaving for the cauſe of Fornication, cauſes her to commit Adultery: and he that marrieth her committeth Adultery,</hi> Mat 5.32. Nay, the New Teſtament is full of Exhortations for the making the Marriage State comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and happy. It engages us to Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Chaſtity by the Honour of the Duty, and the Wickedneſs of the violation of it. <hi>Marriage is honourable in all, and the Bed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled; but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge,</hi> Heb. 13.4. It enjoyns a moſt particular Love and Affection to each: St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands the Ancient Women to Inſtruct the Younger ones <hi>to be ſober, and to love their Husbands,</hi> as if none but who did ſo could be Sober, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.4. And in many other places, the Husband is obliged <hi>to love his Wife as Chriſt loved the Church,</hi> to <hi>love his Wife even as himſelf;</hi> which imply the higheſt and moſt ardent degree of Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Therefore, they that do any ways contribute to the breach of this Love and Fidelity, have a better pretence to be Turks or Heathens, or any thing, than Chriſtians. But to make an Eſtimate of the Wickedneſs of the violation of Conjugal Chaſtity, be pleaſed to take a view of Adultery in its threefold Aſpect.</p>

Of the Wickedneſs of this Sin on the part of the <hi>Adulterous Wife.</hi> Whatever guilt is contracted by the Adulterous Husband, the ſame is imputable to the Adulterous Wife, becauſe of the mutualneſs of their Matrimonial Promiſes, and their other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to a mutual Gratitude. But on the Womans ſide, that is guilty of this Crime, there ſupervenes an Additional Wickedneſs. She, before ſhe can arrive at this pitch of Impiety, muſt offer violence to her Nature, break through all the Fences of her Natural Modeſty, and Steel her Forehead with the moſt hardened Impudence. She is not only guilty of the Breach of ſo many Oaths and Vows of Ingratitude to her kind Protector and Cheriſher, but is perfidiouſly Diſloyal to her Head and Superiour, to whom ſhe owes ſo much Obſervance and Obedience; for whoſe ſake ſhe ought not only to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Chaſtity entire, but even an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted and unqueſtionable Reputation; and therefore to Defile his Bed with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of an impure Adulterer, is not only
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97801:57"/>
an Injury but a Treaſon, a moſt Diſloyal and an Impious Conſpiracy. But the horrid conſequences of the Fact ſets her Crime above all Eſtimation; to Baſtardize a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perhaps, to wrong her own Children of their Paternal Inheritance, to take off the Fathers Love from his own Children, and make him look upon them all as an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if not a Spurious Progeny; to cauſe him to deny a ſufficient Maintenance even to his true Born Sons, and perhaps, to leave them Poor and Succourleſs in the midſt of his Affluence. Theſe are ſuch miſerable and fatal Events of this Crime, that ſhe, that notwithſtanding all this, ſhall engage upon it, muſt, one would think, have diveſted her ſelf of all the Tenderneſs of her Sex, and have put on a ſort of a Deviliſh Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thus to offer to him in requital of his Love and Kindneſs, ſuch an irreparable and inſupportable Injury.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97801:57"/>
purpoſely hid from us; but I think rather that it aroſe chiefly from the lapſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who were not till then <hi>aſham d of their Nakedneſs,</hi> till Sin had raiſed in them ſuch diſorderly Appetites and Inclinations, to which they were greater ſtrangers before; at the thoughts whereof, they were confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and did endeavour, as much as they could, to hide them from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of others. But be this as it will, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man finds within himſelf a Natural deſire to skreen over with ſilence every thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to theſe matters; and we ſee that thoſe People that have laid aſide this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Shamefacedneſs, and given themſelves up to <hi>Obſcene Talk</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accounted ſome of the greateſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Nature; that have offer'd more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to her than any Men beſide. And therefore it is obſerved, that in all Civiliz'd Nations, this practice has been uſed only by the meaneſt and baſeſt ſort of People; but thoſe of a more refined Education have had the utmoſt abhorrence of it. And we may further obſerve, that nothing is ſo great a Guard to Vertue as Modeſty is; for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, when the Devil has made himſelf Maſter of all the other Fences, this holds out till the very laſt. And therefore Men ſhould be very cautious of abandoning that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97801:58"/>
Hold, which is oftentimes ſtronger than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Grace together. And indeed, if we ſhould ſet this ſingle paſſion aſide, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would become a Herd of Goats and Satyrs, there would be no Order or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no diſtinction of Blood or Families, no Care or Proviſion for Children, but the whole Race of Rational Beings would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more Beaſts than the Cattle of the Field. And this ſeems to me to be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why God did implant (ſince the Fall at leaſt) this Pudicity in Mankind alone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deſigned Matrimonial Co-habitation and a diſtinction of Families amongſt Men, which he did not among Beaſts, when he allowed them promiſcuous Commixtures: Now this Natural Shamefacedneſs is as it were Natures check to all raſh and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Love, which being afforded in a greater degree to the Female Sex, does reſpite any indiſcreet and unequal Propoſals among young People, till ſuch time as the more Mature and Wiſer Judgments of Parents may interpoſe. Therefore I much wonder why ſo many of our Youth of both Sexes ſhould purpoſely endeavour, by a vitious Converſation, and an affected bold Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to deſtroy their inbred Modeſty, which is ſo very Natural, and withal ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beautiful to behold: for Impudence, tho'
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97801:58"/>
it cannot bluſh, is ten times more uggly and ſhameful than the greateſt Shamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſeeing a Young man trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his being put out of Countenance by a confident Man, <hi>Be not concerned,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for this is the colour of Vertue.</hi> But I am afraid a great many think Vertue to be of another Colour, when they make all their Actions to look of ſo different a hew: For how can one reconcile with Natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty thoſe Obſcene Jeſts, which are the Themes of ſo many Virgin Tongues; who take themſelves to be moſt <hi>Witty</hi> when they are moſt <hi>Bold,</hi> and do only <hi>Laugh</hi> at that which ſhould in all reaſon make them <hi>Bluſh?</hi> It is a ſad ſign of the prevailing Immodeſty of the Age, that one can hardly hear a good Tune, but the Obſcenity of the Words is more grating to the Ears than the Muſick is Melodious. Our common Dances are a ſort of Anti-Pirrhick ones, and reſemble the Camp of <hi>Venus,</hi> as the others did thoſe of <hi>Mars.</hi> Nay, our very Makers and Actors of Plays, are wont to excuſe the immodeſty of them by the Humour of the Age, which will bear nothing more ſerious; and hardly any thing is more common, than to ſee Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of reputed Vertue and Honour, to ſit admiring Spectators at ſuch Plays, from which <hi>Cato</hi> would have run away faſter rhan

But hold! It is not my Buſineſs here to write a Satyr upon the Age, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recommend Modeſty, which we ought to ſhew in all our Words and Actions, not to ſpeak any thing which doth in the leaſt ſavour of Filthineſs or Obſcenity, rather to loſe our Jeſt than our Reputation, and to part with a Lewd Company ſooner than our own Innocence; to uſe no Actions which betoken any Laſciviouſneſs or Impurity, but rather to chooſe to be taxed with an inbred Shamefacedneſs, than with an unchriſtian Impudence.</p>

                  <p>A Proud Man can never be ſaid to Contemn the World, altho', perhaps, he Contemns every Man in it: The World is his Kingdom, in which he has Enthroned himſelf, and therefore expects <hi>all that dwell

The proud Man, tho' he may ſometimes chance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Riches or Senſual Pleaſures, yet Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is ſuch a Deity that he muſt adore, for the ſake of which he will forfeit his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Integrity, his Quiet and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, altho' it be but Imaginary; therefore ſuch a Man is as <hi>Carnally Minded,</hi> and as far from the Contempt of the World, as the greateſt Miſer or Voluptuary in it. But the humble Chriſtian, that with a modeſt Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſubmits himſelf to the Divine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that retains but indifferent Thoughts of his own ſelf, and pays all due preference and reſpect to others, may truly be ſaid to Contemn the World with its Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which ſo great a part of Mankind do Idolize.

                     </gap>ſoever God is pleaſed to impart to our Knowledge, or to promiſe to our Hopes, we muſt with an
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97801:60"/>
humble Faith and Affiance rely upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word; we muſt not with an haughty Diſdain deny the Truth, becauſe it doth not comport with the Maxims of our weak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſlight the Promiſe, becauſe the greatneſs of it is above our expectation, and the ways of effecting it beyond our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. We ought rather to conſider, that 'tis the God of Truth that ſpeaks to us, and therefore who cannot impoſe a Falſity upon us; that he is a God of an Incomprehenſible Being, of an Immenſe and Infinite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that therefore we ſhould not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Myſterious Nature by the ſcantineſs of our Underſtanding; that he is a God of an unbounded Power, who can with eaſe obviate all occurring Difficulties; who can make all ſeeming Contrarieties conſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our advantage, and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good of his Promiſe; and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot fail us. So likewiſe <hi>in praiſing God,</hi> and returning thanks to him for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies received, we cannot perform our Duty better, than by an <hi>humble acknowledgment</hi> that all the good things we enjoy do proceed from his Bounty and Favour. For as for Pride, that poſſeſſes a Man with ſo much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, that he had rather impute his Succeſs and Felicity to ſecond Cauſes, than to the All-Wiſe direction of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97801:61"/>
Therefore, whenever we partake of the Divine Favours, by delivering us either from Calamities, or by beſtowing Bleſſings upon us, we muſt not like <hi>Jeſhurun was fat and kick, and lightly eſteem the Rock of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Deut. 32.15. or like the Iſraelites <hi>forget the Lord their God who had done ſo great things for them,</hi> Pſal. 106. And as God by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Ephraim, Their heart was exalted, therefore have they forgotten me,</hi> Hoſ. 13.6. We muſt not with the proud King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſay, <hi>By the ſtrength of my Hand I have done it, and by my Wiſdom, for I am prudent,</hi> Iſ. 10.13. but we muſt with an humble Gratitude acknowledge that all the good things we enjoy do proceed from God Almighty's Bounty, that our Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was too ſhort, and our Endeavours too frail, to effect ſo advantagious a Bleſſing, that our Contrivances might have failed in a thouſand particulars if the Divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence had not aſſiſted them; that we had never proſecuted ſo proper Methods, if the <hi>Wiſdom which is from above</hi> had not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Underſtandings, and furthered our Counſels and Debates; that he might have blaſted our deſigns in the firſt Enterpriſe, or might have ſuffered us to have attempted ſuch Projects as might have ended in our own Ruin and Deſtruction. We ought not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97801:61"/>
to think that <hi>it was for our righteouſneſs, or for the uprightneſs of our heart, that God has done this great thing for us,</hi> Deut. 9.5. for what can we wretched Sinners claim at Gods hands, when our repeated Crimes have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited ſo many puniſhments, rather than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, of him? But we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that altho' we had been never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, no Thanks could have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them, becauſe they had been ſo freely beſtow'd; but when they are ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully given to them, who have deſerved ſo much worſe Treatment, we ought to admire and adore the Munificent Hand which ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally conveyed them to us. And in this ſtrain of an humble Gratitude, we find the Pious Saints of Old commemorating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercies and Benefits. So holy <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of the mercies which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; for with my Staff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two Bands.</hi> So the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Pſalmiſt, <hi>Who am I, and what is my People? for all things come from thee, and of thy own have we given thee.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14 And laſtly, we ought with an <hi>humble ſubmiſſion to bear whatſoever afflictions God is pleaſed to lay upon us.</hi> We muſt not in a fit of impatience ſay, <hi>God is cruel unto us,</hi> Job 30.21. we muſt not repent us of our Service to him, as they did
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97801:62"/>
who cried, <hi>What profit is it to ſerve the Lord;</hi> but we ought rather, under the ſevereſt Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, with old <hi>Ely,</hi> to ſay, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. or, with holy <hi>Job, What, ſhall we receive good things at the hands of God, and ſhall we not recevie Evil?</hi> Job 2.10. So that whenever God thinks fit to ſend his Scourge to Chaſtize us for our faults, our <hi>Humility</hi> will teach us not with a Stomachful Rage to fly in the face of our kind Parent, who deſigns by his ſeeming ſeverity our greateſt benefit; but will make us acknowledge, that our ſins have merited a far ſharper Tryal, and that it is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that he is pleaſed to accept ſo ſlight a puniſhment for ſo heinous offences; that he does not <hi>delight in plaguing us,</hi> and that he <hi>will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able;</hi> that our afflictions ſerve only to refine our Vertue, and to give it a greater luſtre in this World, or elſe to make our Crowns ſhine brighter in the other.</p>

It were an Impudence intolerable
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97801:62"/>
for a Beggar to ſtrut about in a borrowed Livery, and to Diſpute his Gentility with thoſe that knew who had furniſhed him out with thoſe Habiliments. Nor would it be more Modeſty for a Servant, to ſet a value upon himſelf, and to deſpiſe his Fellows, only becauſe his Maſter had Depoſited a little of his Money in his Hand; and which he might reaſonably expect would be every Minute called in. Now, if we conſider, there is not any thing which men uſually pride themſe ves in, but they have as little reaſon to do it as in any of theſe Inſtances; For of all the things that we do enjoy, and which are uſed ſo to ſwell our Minds, what is there that we can in a true and proper ſenſe call our own, that we our ſelves have the abſolute command of, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which does not depend upon the Good Will and Pleaſure of Almighty God? <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> are things, alas, which too many value themſelves upon, as if they were to be for ever entailed upon them; as if they were ſubject to no contingencies, but were wholly exempt from the Juriſdiction of him, who is the great Conducter and Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of all Human Affairs.

How may we daily obſerve an under-working Providence, to daſh all our Deſigns of laying up Wealth and improving our Eſtates, and notwithſtanding the utmoſt of our Endeavours, to make thoſe vaſt Poſſeſſions, which we had been ſo long heaping together, to vaniſh of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and to cauſe that mighty Fortune, which we thought, alas! to Entail for ever upon our Poſterity, to Decay and Die before our ſelves?</p>
                  <p>How often do we ſee Men, that ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very Pinacle of <hi>Honour,</hi> that <hi>ſit on the right hand of Princes,</hi> and walk along through the bowing Crowd, that have all Elogiums

and Praiſes of Good Men, and all the Crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Flattery of the Bad; how often do we ſee theſe tumbling down into Diſgrace and Contempt, by a blaſt only, perhaps, of Popular Rumour, by the frowns of an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prince, or by the undermining Practices of an aſpiring Favorite? But altho' it ſhould happen, that we ſhould be ſuch Darlings of Fortune, as never to Experience her Frowns, but to run thro' a Life of perfect Calm and Sunſhine, tho' our Riches ſhould accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us even to the Grave, and tho' we ſhould Die full of Honour, yet there we muſt take our leave of all this gawdy Pageantry; when we go into the other World we muſt leave behind us all theſe things we have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a ſcramble for in this, thither we muſt go Naked, and Stripped of all theſe Gaities, and leave them to go to God knows whom, and God knows where. Now let the reaſonable Man conſider, if he can with any confidence be proud of ſuch fleeting Enjoyments, that are frequently ſhorter than our Lives are, that for the moſt part leave us, or it is but a little while and we muſt leave them.

Spirit in Man, and the inſpiration of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty giveth him underſtanding.</hi> The profoundeſt Wiſdom of the moſt Sage Politicians, is but a glimmering Ray of his Eternal Wiſdom, which whenever he thinks fit to withdraw, or obſcure, and to leave them to themſelves, they do nothing then but reaſon themſelves into Danger, and all their fair Plots and Contrivances are but ſo many Stratagems turn'd againſt their own Cauſe: However, they may pride themſelves in their dark Counſels and deep laid Deſigns, when <hi>they ſay in their Heart who ſhall ſee it;</hi> yet God, whoſe <hi>fooliſhneſs is wiſer than Men,</hi> he <hi>bringeth the Wiſdom of the Heathen to nought,</hi> and <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the counſel of</hi> Achitophel <hi>into fooliſhneſs.</hi> By a blaſt of his Diſpleaſure, he can daſh all their Projects into nothing, and turn all the beſt formed Deſigns into Ruin and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Nay, further, how often may we ſee many of thoſe great States-men, upon whoſe Management the Fates of Princes and Nations have turned, and others whoſe Parts and Induſtry have made an exact Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of all Arts and Sciences, how often may we ſee many of theſe great Men, not only <hi>to Die as a Fool Dieth,</hi> but for ſome time to live ſo too? Whoſe Parts have left them on this ſide the Grave, and who have not only loſt their mighty Talents of Wiſdom and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97801:65"/>
Learning, but even the ordinary Gifts of our common Nature. Let me then a little apply my ſelf to thoſe whom God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with theſe excellent Qualities; is it the part of a Wiſe Man to pride himſelf in that, which tho' he has it to day, it may be gone to morrow? Is it a thing becoming thoſe that have ſo long Studied Knowledge and Experience, to value themſelves upon a little Superficial Knowledge of ſome few things about us here, which can laſt but ſome thirty or forty years at the moſt, and then muſt be Eternally buried in Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion?</p>
                  <p>But of all Prides, that which ſeems to confront Heaven moſt, is the <hi>Spiritual One;</hi> This is a Sin of the moſt hardened Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that, with all its Blackneſs of Guilt about it, can demurely plead its own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and ſet up for Sanctity with the Qualification of a Devil. Other ſins, as conſcious of their own Guilt, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Puniſhment, dread the Almighty's Vengeance, and ſly his Preſence; but this, like its Father the Devil, in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> comes among the <hi>Sons of God, and preſents it ſelf before the Lord:</hi> This, inſtead of ſhunning him, dares oppoſe him to his Face, inſtead
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97801:65"/>
of fearing Puniſhment, expects Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now when the Holy Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that it is <hi>God that worketh in us both to Will and to Do,</hi> and that of our ſelves we are not able to think a good Thought; what Impudence is it to be Proud and Haughty upon the Free Grace of God, which <hi>like the Wind bloweth where it listeth,</hi> and to deſpiſe others, upon whom God has not beſtowed ſuch plentiful Effuſions. Surely Men muſt be paſt all Modeſty, to pretend to be the peculiar Children of God, to boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of extraordinary Talents of Grace, and to deſpiſe all the World which have not the ſame Confidence with them, as <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding all this, to make themſelves to be the pureſt Members of that Holy Religion, whoſe greateſt Characteriſticks are <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As for other Points of Pride, there is more reaſon to be ſhewn for them than for this; for he that is Proud of Beauty, or Wit, or a good Eſtate, has ſomething to ſhew for it; but he that Prides himſelf to take Place of another, to be called by ſome worſhipful
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97801:66"/>
Name he is fond of, does take up, methinks, with the Pride of <hi>Bedlam;</hi> where the poor Folks ſtrut about with Tinſel and Feathers, and ſtand admiring and ſtaring at their own Shadows. What a fooliſh, as well as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wretch was <hi>Hamman</hi> in the Book of <hi>Eſther,</hi> who would venture his Honour, his Fortune, and his Life it ſelf, only to force a poor <hi>Jew</hi> to give him the Leg? And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever puts himſelf to any Trouble to gain the like Obſervances, is not one jot the Wiſer. For to attempt this and miſcarry, is but to expoſe our ſelves to the Mirth and Scorn of others; and if we are ſo happy as to ſucceed, the Succeſs will hardly compenſate the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For what difference is there between the Air of the Right-hand, or that of the Left? a Man may breath in one as well as the other, and if either of the two will do him more harm, it is probably that which is moſt curſt. One may have the ſame Chear, when he ſits fourth at a Table, as well as if he ſate firſt; and may have as good a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach too, if his Pride does not ſpoil it, as he would if he ſate higher. But however, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Man can be ſuch a Fool as to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue theſe things, yet Pride is the worſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he can take to effect it: To ſeek for Precedency is the ſureſt way to loſe it; and People will generally court a modeſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97801:66"/>
humble Man to take that Place, which they refuſe to the proud aſpiring One. Which is the Obſervation of our Bleſſed Saviour: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will be Chief among you, let him be your Servant,</hi> Mat. 20.27. And again, <hi>When thou art bidden to a Wedding, go and ſit down in the loweſt Room, that when he that bad thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he may ſay unto thee, Friend, go up higher,</hi> Luk. 14.10. Not that our Saviour would have us affect Humility, and to debaſe our ſelves out of a Politick Deſign of Exaltation and Advancement; but that if we be truly Humble in this reſpect, we have this additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Encouragement to our Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Honour of Men,</hi> as well as the <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To be Humble, is,<note place="margin">Not to affect Things above us.</note> 
                     <hi>Not to affect Thtngs above our Abilities and Circumſtances.</hi> For, 1. The Proud Man is always outſhooting his Mark, and wading beyond his Depth; he is for medling with things he doth not underſtand, and is for giving his Judgment in Matters he does not comprehend; he is for undertaking Buſineſs he is not able to perform, and all out of a vain Opinion he has conceived of his own Parts and Abilities. Indeed the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſtrangely peſtered with theſe ſelfcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Opiniators, that leave their Calling
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97801:67"/>
to let their Heads run upon new Schemes and Platforms of Government; whoſe Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation has hardly been beyond the Anvil, and yet they would fain be tinkering the Church and State. Of ſuch kind of People the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Who deſired to be Teachers of the Laws, when they underſtood neither what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed.</hi> And truly we ſhould be well taught and governed by ſuch Mens Rules, who are ſo far from underſtanding Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Government, that they underſtand not what they ſay. But the <hi>Humble Man,</hi> like the good Pſalmiſt, <hi>exerciſes not himſelf in great Matters, nor in thingt that are too high for him:</hi> He makes the Sphere of his Action within his own Knowledge; he leaves great Matters for wiſer Heads; he does not <hi>begin to Build when he is not able to Finiſh;</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that the Buſineſs of his own Calling, and the Saving of his own Soul is Work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him, ſo as not to trouble himſelf with other Mens Buſineſs, which he has little time for, and which he leſs underſtands. 2. So again, the Proud Man is always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to live above what his Income will maintain; he is ambitious to vie Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences with Men of the largeſt Fortunes, to ape the Sumptuouſneſs of ſome great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe Eſtate his falls much ſhort of;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97801:67"/>
to make a mighty Blaze with coſtly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, rich Furniture, and a ſplendid Equipage, at a time when his Fortune per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is running at the loweſt Ebb. But <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> teaches a Man to live within thoſe Circumſtances God has placed him in; ſo that he is content to live up to the Quality of his own Condition, and does not care to ruine himſelf to make other People, for ſome time, fancy he is Rich; and makes him will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take up with the ordinary Reſpect which is due to his Condition, without ſpending his Eſtate to gain a flaſhy Repute, which will at laſt end in Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. 3. It again teaches us not to Pride our ſelves in our Apparel, or to wear Cloaths which are unſuitable to our Circumſtances, or above our Condition. One could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think that Mankind could degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo much ſenſeleſſneſs, and Folly, as we find ſo many Men are, to value themſelves upon the outward Habiliments and Covering of their Body, and to deſpiſe all others, who have not the Fortune, or the Vanity to get ſo tawdry a Caſe for theirs. The Body it ſelf is but the Shell, or the Casket for the Soul, or the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it; and therefore that which we wrap about the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt certainly be a thing too vile to Pride our ſelves upon. To be proud of Wit
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97801:68"/>
or Learning, is ſomething tolerable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this; but to be proud of fine Cloaths, is as ſilly as to overlook the Jewel, whilſt we admire the Caſe. But for thoſe to be fond of them, who have not Fortune enough to attain them, who cannot make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Fine without making themſelves Poor, is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Vanity of Vanities</hi> with a Witneſs; and they, of all People in the World, do leaſt deſerve to be pitied, who are ſo vain as to ſtarve their own Bellies to feed other Peoples Eyes by gazing on them. I would not be miſ-underſtood, as if I thought the Office of Cloaths was not as well to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Qualities, as to defend us from the Weather; for certainly, Perſons of better Rank ought to wear better and coſtlier Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; but it ought not to be ſillily Fanciful, or prodigiouſly expenſive. The moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and Wealthy ſhould not wear that upon their Backs, which would build Cities, and ranſome Kings, as ſome have done. But for People of a meaner Rank, they ought to be more Plain and Frugal in their Attire, for God has placed them in a lower Condition, and therefore for them to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit an higher, is to repine and murmur at at his good Providence, and oftentimes to ſacrifice the Well-being of themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, to this fooliſh and unaccountable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

One thinks himſelf too much a States-man to be governed by any body elſe, and that things will never go well unleſs he were advanced to the Helm of Affairs, and attributes all the Miſcarriages which happen, the not following his Projects. The Ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in almoſt all Rebellions, have been but ſome proud diſcontented Spirits, who could not brook a Diſgrace from their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, or the Diſappointment of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> are two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtances in Church Hiſtory, of Men that broached their Hereſies, becauſe they miſſed thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Dignities they pretended to. And I doubt not, if we were to Anatomize the preſent Schiſms from our National Church, we ſhould quickly find, that the Non-compliance (of our more
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97801:69"/>
knowing Diſſenters eſpecially, and where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is not concerned) proceeds only from this, that they ſcorn to own themſelves to have ſo long continued in an Error; and that they cannot brook to comply with thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they have ſo unreaſonably, and ſo ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed. Nay, all the diſobedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants we ever knew, have chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been tempted to this Sin, by the Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of their Minds, by their diſdaining to ſubmit to the Diſcretion of others, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves <hi>wiſer than their Teachers.</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he enjoyns <hi>the Younger to be ſubject to the Elder,</hi> he adds, <hi>and be ye cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Humility,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Duty of <hi>Humility</hi> is the greateſt Motive to that of <hi>Obedience.</hi> For the Man of a modeſt humble Mind, thinks that his Superiors do better underſtand the Art of Governing than he; that there are ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Springs of their Actions which he is not let into; that Succeſs does not always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the beſt laid Deſigns, and that it is better to accuſe his own Ignorance in ſuch Affairs, than their Abilities or Sincerity. Such an one can with Temper and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuffer his Prince to take back into his Hands a Place of Honour or Advantage, or to deny him a requeſted Favour: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, he ought rather to pay his Gratitude
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97801:69"/>
for the gracious Bounty which beſtowed it at firſt, and continued it ſo long, and not to meditate Revenge upon him, becauſe he is bountiful no longer; he thinks with himſelf, that it is ſome Defect in his Qualifications, or that he has not yet enough merited the Favour he deſired. So likewiſe Humility doth bound the Ambition of aſpiring Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, makes them leave the Judgment of their Merits to thoſe whom the Laws have entruſted with Preferments; it keeps them from making importunate Sollicitations and Addreſſes to Great Men, and teaches them to bear a Repulſe with Meekneſs and Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence; it puts them upon Enquiry, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Piety and Learning were equal to the Greatneſs of their Competition, and ſo for the future makes them double their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that their Defects may be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a Bar to their Preferment. It teaches Children to honour and obey their Parents, by conſidering, that their Age and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the World has endowed them with a greater Share of Prudence; and therefore that it is more fitting to govern their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by their Advice and Direction, than by their own green Underſtandings: It inſtructs Servants to pay all dutiful Obedience to their Maſters, by putting them in mind, that it is unreaſonable to diſpute their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97801:70"/>
whoſe Subjection they have placed themſelves under; to think that their Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is more irrational than their Maſters Injunctions, who are to be ſuppoſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their own Buſineſs beſt. Now if all Men would endeavour to ſquare their Actions by theſe Rules, which Humility doth ſuggeſt, what glorious Times, or what Halcyon Days ſhould we behold! what Eaſe and Quiet to the Government, what Peace and Tranquility to the State, how much Charity and Piety would reign in the Church, what Fidelity would be found at Court, and what Heartineſs and Obedience in City and Country! If we ſhould all do our utmoſt in the Performance of this Duty, we ſhould find ſuch a ſtrange Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in all things of publick Concern, and private Order and Obedience; ſo much Peace, and Love, and Unity, ſo much Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Advantage and Proſperity, that we ſhould in a manner be perſuaded, like the People of <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> that <hi>the Gods were come down to us in the likeneſs of Men,</hi> Act. 14.11.</p>

And ſo in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when thoſe that are our Inferiours deſire our Speech, our Advice, or our Relief, we ought to give them an eaſie Acceſs, and a kind Admittance. We ought not to intrench our ſelves within obſcure and remote Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to ſet a Guard of ſurly Servants to keep out all Addreſſes and Applications
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97801:71"/>
that are made to us: For really it is one of the moſt unreaſonable, and moſt unjuſt things in the World, to deny a Man before he can be heard, and to refuſe his Petition without knowing what it is. It is a ſhame to ſee, how much the Great Men of our Times have ſell beneath the Generoſity of the Grandees in the Roman State. They looked upon it as the greateſt Glory they could arrive to, to be Patrons to the diſtreſſed <hi>Plebeians,</hi> tho' of the meaneſt Rank; they made it their Buſineſs to court and win over Clients into their Patronage; they bravely extended their Protection, not only to private Men, to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Tribes, but even to whole Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Countries: They accounted this to be a new Beam of Honour, which ſhone upon them with far greater Luſtre than their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Titles; and many, by defending an injured Client, have thought they have ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an equal Honour with a triumphing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Read but the Hiſtories of thoſe Times, and ſee what a World of Good was done to the People by the <hi>Letnuli</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii,</hi> by the <hi>Catos</hi> and <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and what an expanded Beneficence did they afford. And then again, Conſider what a few Imitators they have among the Great Men of our Age; many of whom wrap themſelves up like Hedg-Hogs, within their own Prickles,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97801:71"/>
place ſo many Janiſaries and Sentinels about them, on purpoſe, to keep them even from the Temptation of doing Good. So again, When we converſe with our Inferiours, we ought to ſhew ſo due Courteouſneſs and Obligingneſs in our Diſcourſe, and be far from all Moroſe and Inſolent Treatment. There is no reaſon to think that we ſhould raile at, and miſcall our poor Fellow Chriſtians worſe than we do our Dogs, or to return ill Language to them, who approach us with all Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reſpect: For by the Rights of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Humanity, the pooreſt Man may claim from us civil Uſage; and to treat him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, is an Affront offered to Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which all Mankind ſtand obliged to reſent. And of this the honourable <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo very ſenſible, that when they were in Places of Great Buſineſs, in which they were obliged to converſe with a Multitude of the Citizens, they were wont to keep their <hi>Nomenclator,</hi> which was a Servant, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtood by them to give them the Name of all Perſons who came to them, to the end that they might ſalute them with all poſſible Familiarity, and to endeavour to be beforehand with them in the Complement. 'Tis noble Advice, that of the Wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach, Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine Ear to the Poor, and give him a Friendly Anſwer with

Meekneſs,</hi> Eccl 4.8. And if Great Men did conſider how they riveted themſelves into the Love of ordinary People by a courteous Behaviour to them, what faſt hold they took of their Hearts by good Words, a ſerene Brow, and a pleaſing Countenance; how an humble Deportment, without any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, does oblige Men, and how an haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one does turn a Benefit into an Affront; how Men, as well as God, do reſiſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Proud; how they admire the Free and Courteous, and how their Tongues ring in their Commendation; and eſpecially, did they conſider how eaſily and cheap, all this is done, they would certainly at leaſt counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Humble Man, by that Means to grow Great.</p>

It is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign he is Captivated with the Charms of it, when he cannot bear its diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore every one that does deſire to Contemn the World, muſt take care to attain to the Vertue of Patience in all its particulars.

Our Bleſſed Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that inimitable Example of a ſpotleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, had all the blackneſs of Guilt thrown upon him, which the malice of Devils and Deviliſh men could invent.

'Tis to the Judgment of God that we are to ſtand or fall, and not to that of peeviſh men; and if we can keep a Conſcience void of offence in his ſight, who knows our Innocency, we need not much matter how we appear in the vitiated Eyes of others.

certain of Succeſs, till we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it. Then why ſhould we ſet our Hearts upon that which we were not ſure would ever be ours? And why ſhould we be impatient in being diſappointed of ſuch a thing of which we might foreſee ſo many thouſand ways of miſſing?

It ſhould content us that we have managed the whole Deſign with a Prudent and Wiſe contrivance; that we have ſet every Wheel a moving that we thought would work on for our purpoſe; that we have removed every Obſtacle out of the way that ſeemed to lie croſs to us; but if any unforeſeen Accident has ſprung up upon us, which it was not in the reach of Human Wiſdom to provide againſt, and which no prudent man would have thought of; we muſt be content in our Miſcarriage, when our Projects are over ruled by the Providence of Heaven, or by ſome unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97801:77"/>
Contingencies, which we were in no ways Maſters of. Perhaps one ill ſucceſs was owing to the Weakneſs of our own Merits; and we are ſo partial to our ſelves, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan that as our ill Fortune, or an Injury to us, which was but the Reſult of a Wiſe and a Juſt Determination. We ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further, that God oftentimes diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points us in one Deſign, on purpoſe that we may be ſucceſsful in another, which may be more advantageous to us; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Miſcarriage in this is a Patent from Heaven for ſomething better. And laſtly, we ſhould alſo conſider with our ſelves, that God may thus diſappoint our Hopes upon ſome Spiritual Deſign, upon account that ſuch a Preferment may be a Snare to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, a Temptation to Pride or Vain-Glory, Injuſtice and Luxury; he may do it to mortifie ſome Vice within us, to abate and quel our Pride and Ambition, and to ſee how we can brook a Repulſe and a Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; he may bring it about on purpoſe to wean us from the World, that we ſhould not put any Confidence in earthly Things, and to bring us to a more ſtedfaſt Dependance upon his Goodneſs, when we find by our Experience, that all things elſe are ſo liable to fail us. Now to be Impatient or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in theſe Caſes, is to fly in the Face

of Heaven whileſt it is reaching out a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit unto us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Not to be Impatient, although our Children do not ſucceed ſo well in the World as we might have expected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it ſhall pleaſe the Providence of God to be leſs Bountiful to our Children in their Worldly Succeſs; though they do not thrive proportionably to our Expectations, though their Improvement be not anſwerable to the Advantages they have had from us, though their States or Fortunes decreaſe and run backwards, either by accidental Loſſes, or a leſs prudent Management; we ought not to overcharge our Souls with an extravagant Grief for ſuch Miſcarriages. We ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſider, That it is not in Man's power to carve out his own Fortune as he pleaſes; but that it is the Over ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, which deals his Favours out according to his alwiſe Pleaſure: That God has ordained ſeveral States and Conditions of Life in the World, and that every One muſt be ſupplied with one or other; that all cannot be Rich, and ſome muſt be Poor; that there muſt be one to <hi>Grind at the Mill,</hi> as well as one to <hi>ſit upon the Throne;</hi> and therefore among the innumerable Conditions of Life, it is a Mercy that God does not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97801:78"/>
our Children to fall into the loweſt Dregs of Poverty. It is unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the Children of Rich Parents ſhould always be intitled to Riches too; for that were to entail Riches only to pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Families; it would be to confine God's Bounty and Providence juſt to ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to diſcourage the Induſtry of the Poor, by having no poſſibility of an ample Reward. We ſhould think, how that Riches are not the only Happineſs our Children can poſſeſs; that it is a greater Bleſſing to ſee them <hi>Good</hi> than <hi>Wealthy;</hi> that it is a ſweeter Comfort to us, to find that God has diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them <hi>the abundant Rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntoward</hi> Children, we ought not to render our Lives perfectly uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, by our great Impatience under it. It ſhould be a Leſſening of our Grief, when we think of the unſpeakable Mercies of God to all Sinners; how often he finds out the loſt and wandering Sheep, and brings home the Prodigal Son; that he frequently opens the Eyes and Hearts of the moſt Blind and Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting Offenders; that he who could afford Mercy and Pardon to <hi>Magdalen,</hi> that had ſeven Devils, to <hi>Paul</hi> that Perſecuted him,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97801:79"/>
and <hi>Peter</hi> who deny'd him, may, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with our earneſt Prayers, give them Grace to repent and grow better. We ſhould conſider that we have done our Duty in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a Pious and Religious Education, by ſo inſtructing their Minds with good and ſober Principles, and by ſetting before them a pious Example; ſo that their Miſcarriage is owing only to their own Perverſneſs, and that therefore it is unreaſonable by our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to hazard our own Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will neglect theirs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> So again, we ought patiently to behave our ſelves under the <hi>Preſence of Evils,</hi> as well as under the Loſs of <hi>Good Things.</hi> As,</p>

So again, when we have ſome <hi>Great Enterprize</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake here. We may expect to meet with an abundance of unlucky Rubs to croſs our Intentions; where there are a number of Hazards to befall us, which may baffle our Purpoſes, we ought to have Patience to bear with them all, and with an invincible Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to puſh on vigorouſly with our De-Deſign, maugre all the unfortunate Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which may ſeem to diſcourage us in our Reſolution. So likewiſe, when we are to ſet upon ſome <hi>Difficult Study,</hi> the Initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to which are crabbed and unpalatable, we muſt not be impatient for the Hardneſſes of the firſt Undertaking; but muſt labour on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97801:80"/>
with all the Vigor and Alacrity we can, to get the ſooner over with the Difficulty; we ſhould conſider, that thoſe ſtony and thorny Paths let us into Gardens of Pleaſure, and that the Delights we ſhall find there will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above compenſate the Trouble of the Journey thither. And the ſame is to be ſaid of the <hi>Painful Tasks in Religion:</hi> When it ſhall pleaſe the Holy Spirit of God to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us from the Sleep of a ſinful Courſe, and to give us a due Senſe of our Sins, ſo that we reſolve upon Repentance and a New Life; we muſt not be ſcared at the Unpleaſantneſs of ſome Religious Duties, and the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Tasks; we muſt not be deterred from our good Reſolution, when we think how many Sins we have to beg Pardon for; how much of our Life we have to unlive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; how much it will go againſt our Grain and Inclinations, to mortifie thoſe Luſts and Affections which we have been ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging and pampering; but we ought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to go on with the noble Deſign we have undertook; we muſt conſider, that the Aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, which he will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us upon our earneſt Deſires, will make our Work eaſie to us; that when we have a Knowledge of our Danger, we ſhall now ſpring on with an unknown Strength; that our Nature will now riſe above it ſelf, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97801:80"/>
that Miſery, which unleſs ſpeedily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, will certainly overtake us; that it is not a time to conſult our Eaſe and Sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, when the everlaſting Happineſs or Miſery of our Bodies and Souls lies at ſtake; that it requires but little time to bend our Actions, and make them pliable to the Rules of Vertue, and then <hi>her Ways will be Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths Peace;</hi> and which will at laſt be rewarded with thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Joys, <hi>to which the Sufferings of this preſent World are not worthy to be compared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> 
                     <hi>To bear patiently the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of other men.</hi> As we ſuſtain the Office of Maſters or Teachers, we ſhould not let any Infirmities or Imperfections, which our Servants or Scholars are liable to, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us beyond all Patience and Temper: But we ſhould follow the Apoſtles Rule of <hi>Bearing one anothers Burthens,</hi> conſidering that we likewiſe, as Men, are liable to the ſame Imperfections. We muſt not let the <hi>Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of a Servant tranſport us into violent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſins of Anger; but muſt think that it is above the Strength of Human Nature to ſtand always intent and upon their Guard; that a thouſand Contingencies and ill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents will happen, which are beyond the power of the wiſeſt Men to provide againſt,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97801:81"/>
and which it might be impoſſible for a poor Servant ever to have foreſeen; or however, that his wonted Care and Fidelity ought to attone for a little ſlight Inadvertency. We muſt not be outragious at the <hi>Slowneſs</hi> or <hi>Miſapprehenſion</hi> of our Scholars, when they do not preſently take the Hint from us which we give them; when thoſe Notions, which lie ſo plain in our Head, ſeem to lie ſo croſs and perplexed in theirs; for we ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh betwixt the Judgments and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Profeſſors and Learners; their Minds have been long beat to ſuch Notions, which the others never heard of before, That Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity which they have with the Things they teach, makes them appear more eaſie than really they are; nay, they themſelves have forgot, with what tediouſneſs they at firſt acquired them. And we ought to behave our ſelves in the like Manner, when we have a Mind to convince thoſe who are Guilty of ſome <hi>Miſtakes in Opinion:</hi> We muſt not be outragious at them, when we ſee them plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thoſe falſe Notions they have eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for we muſt know, that they are as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally convinced of the Truth of their Opinions, as we are of ours; that this World is ſuch a State of Imperfection, that the moſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Man is not altogether free from Error and Miſunderſtanding; that it is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97801:81"/>
to expect, that our Underſtandings ſhould be the Standards and Meaſures of other Men; that as long as there are different Men in the World, there will be different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that a Man may with as much reaſon hate and affront another for having different Features in his Face, or a different Size of his Body, as for having different Thoughts of the ſame Thing: We ſhould conſider, that an angry peeviſh Diſputant very ſeldom gains his Point, becauſe his Heat is apt to ſpoil his Argument; that Reaſon is of more Force to convince any one than Paſſion; that a calm modeſt way of Arguing, which reſpects the Perſons, whileſt it refutes the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, is like to be ten times more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al than all the loud Bluſterings of an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Adverſary. And ſo again in <hi>Religious Differences,</hi> we ſhould not hate the Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we diſlike their Tenets; every little Contrariety in matter of Faith, ſhould not make us avoid their Converſation, as if they were Heathens and Publicans, or ſet us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extirpating them, as if they were <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi> and <hi>Canaanites;</hi> but ſhould ſtrive rather to win them over by all the Gentleneſs of an obliging Converſation, and a Chriſtian Love; in all our Controverſies, to put on a Spirit of Meekneſs and Condeſcention, a Calmneſs and Sedateneſs of Mind, that ſhall weigh all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97801:82"/>
things deliberately, and determine them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially; that ſhall diſpute without Heat, and convince without Triumph or Reflexion; in ſhort, we ſhould have a generous Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to run through all our Actions towards them, and let our Love go with them, when our Judgment cannot.</p>

                     <hi>Affronts.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>To bear patiently Injuries and Affronts.</hi> I know that the Gallant Men of the Age will agree, if there be no other way to <hi>contemn the World,</hi> but only by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Injuries, and putting up Affronts, they ought rather to deſpiſe that puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Religion, whoſe Doctrines are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Rules of Courage and Honor. For they have unlearned our Saviour's Rule of forgiving our Offending Brother for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty times ſeven</hi> Injuries; and reſolve for every ſlight one, like <hi>Lamech, to be avenged ſeventy and ſeven fold.</hi> But may ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be pleaſed to conſider, that to obey our Saviour's Commands in Forgiving and Loving our Enemies, is a thouſand times more Honorable than their airy Notions of Honor and Satisfaction. For is it not more Brave and Generous to be Maſters of our own Paſſions, rather than to ſuffer them to reign and domineer over us? Is it not more Noble to keep our ſelves in a quiet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97801:82"/>
Temper, to ſit calm and unmoved at the Virulencies of a malicious Tongue; than to ſuffer our Blood to boil up upon every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle petty Offence, and to betray us into the Trouble and Danger of a Duel? Can any thing ſhew a greater ſign of Gallantry, than to poſſeſs a Mind of that Conſtancy and Firmneſs, which can ſuffer no more by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Reproaches, than the Marble can by the Clattering of Hail; the Force of which is ſo far from wounding the other, that it only ſerves to break it ſelf? Is it not really more honorable, to ſhew by a Life of unblemiſhed Integrity, that our Enemies Slander was falſe, than, by our endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take away his Life, to make Men ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we are afraid of his Information? It is a far greater Mark of true <hi>Courage,</hi> to fear God rather than Man: and to be afraid of his Diſpleaſure and Puniſhments, more than of the laviſh Tongue of every impudent Calumniator. But to be afraid of an Affront, and to ruſh boldly upon Damnation, is ſuch a fooliſh Mixture of Boldneſs and Cowardiſe, as wants a Name; it is to ſtand undaunted at the Mouths of loaded Cannons, and to be ſcared at the Crackling of Thorns. Nay, It is certainly more for our Eaſe and Quiet, to ſlight an Injury that ſhall be offered us, than to contrive ways to revenge it; for every
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97801:83"/>
Affront, like the Wind, gathers new Strength by Repercuſſion; or like the Tumbling of a Stone downwards, that was eaſily to be ſtopped at firſt, becomes at laſt irreſiſtible. The patient bearing of Affronts will make Men leave them off, when they find they cannot gain their Deſign in angring us; but, when they find we are vexed and enraged at them, they have got their Point which they aimed at; and their Succeſs in that Attempt will encourage them to another. How much better is it therefore, with a Chriſtian Meekneſs, to paſs by an Injury, or to avoid the Notice of it; to leave the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it to God in the great <hi>Day of Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,</hi> and its Puniſhment to him, <hi>to whom Vengeance belongeth;</hi> by a patient Goodneſs, to follow the Example of our Bleſſed Lord and Savior, who, <hi>when he was reviled, revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not again;</hi> in <hi>Praying for our Perſecutors,</hi> and <hi>rendring them Good for Evil?</hi> This will at laſt mollifie the moſt obdurate Heart, and melt down into Compaſſion, the moſt bowelleſs and unrelenting Cruelty.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis but a ſorrowful Motive which the Stoicks make uſe of, to tell a Man under a raging Fit of the Gout or Stone, that he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97801:83"/>
ſhould not be diſcontented, becauſe Pain is no Evil; when he feels every part about him to give their Principles the Lie. Tho' indeed we may pardon this ſtrange Paradox of theirs, when we conſider they were not ſo well aſſured of a future State, and thought that this Opinion was the beſt way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for that great Queſtion, which ſo puzled the Heathen World, <hi>Why good Men ſhould ſuffer, and evil Men eſcape?</hi> But we Chriſtians are furniſhed with ſuch Arguments to ſuffer any Grief which can befall our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as none of the Schools of the Antients were acquainted with. For we are certain that God ſends theſe Afflictions as a <hi>Scourge to us for our Sins,</hi> to make us take Warning for the future, by the Smart of theſe, how we again tranſgreſs his Commandments; that the Sickneſs of our Bodies is but the Phyſick of our Souls, to bring us nigher to God; that <hi>in our Afflictions we may ſeek him early,</hi> Hoſ. 5.15. A Man muſt be either a perfectly good Man, or an intollerable bad one, whom Sickneſs cannot make better; for although in the time of Health he ſtands proof to all the pious Admonitions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that can be given him, yet Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will awaken him from the drowſieſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, will make him reflect upon thoſe Actions, and liſten to thoſe Motions which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97801:84"/>
he was ſo much a Stranger to before. His Conſcience, which only whiſpered to him then, will now ſpeak in Storms and Thunder; and his Sins, which only now and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted him before, by ſome ſecret Miſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, will now ſtare him broad in the Face, and amaze him into amendment. Therefore we have no reaſon to repine and to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient under thoſe bodily Infirmities which are the Marks of God's Correction; we ought rather to ſhew our Gratitude to him, for accepting this in lieu of far greater Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we had deſerved; and with the Holy Pſalmiſt, to <hi>thank the Lord for giving us Warning,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. truſting, that when <hi>God has forgiven all our Iniquities,</hi> he will <hi>cure all our Diſeaſes,</hi> Pſal. 103.3. The poor Heathens could reap but little Comfort from their Sickneſs, becauſe when they were to leave this Body, they knew not where they were to go, and therefore were diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented under any Pain, for fear it tended to the Diſſolution of their Being; they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Soul ſhould be ſtill lodged in its ruinated Cottage here, than either to ſink into nothing, or to be turned naked and ſtript into ſome dark unknown Country. But we Chriſtians have reaſon to rejoyce and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph when Sickneſs approaches us, hoping that it is the joyful Summons for us to take
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97801:84"/>
our Leave of the Miſeries of a troubleſome World, and to take Poſſeſſion of a <hi>Crown incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, which fadeth not away.</hi> For if Men take care to lead their Lives with that Piety which the Goſpel recommends, and which will entitle them to Heaven, and aſcertain them of Salvation; the Heralds of Peace to a diſtreſſed People, nor the Meſſenger of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to a diſpairing Criminal, will not be half ſo unwelcome as a laſt Sickneſs is to them, who <hi>deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is better.</hi>

                  <p>Now to <hi>ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> is what every Chriſtian is to expect, and to prepare for; although in theſe peaceable Times of the Goſpel, but a few in compariſon of the former Ages are called out to it. For our Saviour gives it as a general Rule to all his Followers: <hi>He that will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me,</hi> Mat. 16.24. And he threatens our Failure herein with no leſs than eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>He that denieth me before Men, him will I deny before my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 10.33. Therefore whenever God thinks fit to ſummon us in to give Teſtimony to the Faith by our Sufferings, Perſecutions or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97801:85"/>
then we muſt with an humble Contentedneſs and Reſignation, ſubmit our ſelves to the Divine Will and Pleaſure; we muſt with readineſs reach out our Hand to receive the bitter Cup; <hi>counting it all Joy when we fall into diverſe Tribulations, and when we are thought worthy to ſuffer for the ſake of Chriſt.</hi> For it ſhews but a pitiful zeal for our Religion, to ſtand up for it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we proſper and flouriſh under it; to follow Chriſt only whilſt he feeds us with the Loaves, and to forſake him in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and at <hi>Mount Calvary.</hi> This indeed is the hardeſt Leſſon which Chriſtianity teaches; but then it is encouraged with the moſt glorious Rewards, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. The Hopes of this made the Primitive Profeſſors of our Religion, with the greateſt Earneſtneſs, even to deſire and pray for Martyrdom, and to wiſh for the greateſt of Sufferings, to the end that they might enjoy the greater Reward, The Hopes of this inſpired thoſe noble Armies of Martyrs with that brave Spirit and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as made them outface Death in his grimeſt Aſpect; that made tender Virgins to leave the Nuptial Garlands for the Crown of Martyrdom; that enabled others to go ſinging to the Racks and the Lyons, to ſmile upon the Gridirons, and in the midſt of the

                     <p>That a Contempt of the World doth conſiſt in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Affections upon God and Heavenly Things.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HItherto Morality has ſhewed us the way <hi>to Contemn the World,</hi> and the dusky Lamp of Nature has gone before us, and afforded us Light enough to diſcover the Vanities thereof; and how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and diſhonourable it is for a Rational Creature to be defiled by thoſe Pleaſures, or overcome by thoſe Paſſions, which betray him into Covetouſneſs and Exceſs, Pride and Impatience. For many of the Heathen World have been eminent in thoſe Vertues we have hitherto been deſcribing; or at leaſt they have pretended to them as much as the devouteſt Chriſtian. They have been ſo <hi>magnanimouſly</hi> Brave, as to ſcorn to do a baſe thing, for the ſake of the Honourableneſs of Vertue, and the Turpitude of Vice: They have deſpiſed all the <hi>Riches</hi> of the World with the moſt faſtidious Contempt; they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97801:86"/>
have been <hi>Temperate</hi> to admiration, have been <hi>Modeſt</hi> as the Recluſeſt Veſtal, and Chaſt as the <hi>Flamen</hi>'s Bed; they have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all proffered <hi>Honour,</hi> and affected the meaneſt Obſcurity; they have bore Pain with an invincible Patience, and outfaced Death it ſelf with a ſtupendious Bravery. But yet there are ſome farther Heights which Chriſtianity enjoyns, that are neceſſary to a true Contempt of the World, and which the Heathens were ignorant of. And thoſe are contained in that former Part of the Apoſtles Precept, <hi>Set your Affections on things above, and not on things on the Earth,</hi> Col. 3.2. Now a great Number of them, like Men of Senſe and Spirit, thought theſe little things <hi>upon the Earth,</hi> were too vile to <hi>ſet their Affections on,</hi> and that it would reflect upon their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality to be enamoured with ſuch fleeting Pleaſures: But then they were unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the former Part of the Command; for they had but very imperfect Notions of thoſe <hi>things above,</hi> which are the true and noble Objects of our Affections. Theſe clear Manifeſtations which God has been pleaſed to make to us of his Nature, and the unqueſtionable Promiſes he has given us of an eternal Reward in another Life, have in them a Magnetick Attraction to raiſe our Affections a great deal higher, to hinder
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97801:86"/>
their dull Weight from pulling them down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Earth, and do as it were draw them to another Centre. Morality indeed might effect, that a Man ſhould not lie groveling upon the Ground, and wallowing in ſenſual Pleaſures; it would enable him in ſome meaſure to ſtand erect, like a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature, and not to ſtoop down to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very puny Object that lay before him; but thoſe happy Revelations, which our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on affords us, inſpire us with a ſort of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Nature, joyn the <hi>Seraph</hi> and the Man together, add Wings to the Soul, and make her take her Flight toward Heaven. This ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Affections on things above. This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Mindedneſs, which is ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Scripture, does conſiſt in theſe two Particulars,

                  <p>By the <hi>Love of God,</hi> I do not underſtand here the whole Duty of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for the Love of God ſometimes ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies as largely as the <hi>Fearing</hi> him does, that is, the doing every thing which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to the utmoſt of our Power; and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97801:87"/>
then the Love of God takes in all the Duties of Morality and revealed Religion. As the Apoſtle takes it, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8. <hi>Every thing worketh for good to them that love God.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear hath heard the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Neither do I mean any unuſual tranſported Spirit of Mind, by which the Soul is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally filled with Exultations and Raptures, whenever it happens to think of God. For theſe, where they are found, are rather the Effects of mens bodily Conſtitutions, than the peculiar Symptoms of a true Chriſtian Love; which is beſt when it is conſtant, and even throughout the whole Courſe of our Lives, and does not take us by Fits and Spurts. Where-ever ſuch paſſionate Returns of Zeal are found, they are good Signs, and Indications of Piety, but they are not Piety it ſelf; they do uſually ſhew a Man to be good, but they do not make him ſo; ſuch heated Tranſports do no more entitle a Man to the Love of God, than an exceſſive Cuſtom of Laughter entitles him to be a riſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But by a Love of God, <hi>I underſtand that Complacency which we take in the Deity, ariſing from the Conſideration of the Excellence of his Nature, and his Bounty to us.</hi> For any thing may be rendered the Object of our Love, either by having very great Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97801:87"/>
and Excellencies in it ſelf, or by the procuring us any conſiderable Benefit. Now for both theſe Reaſons we ought to love God, or to ſet our Affections upon him.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97801:88"/>
Not that we ſhould with a bold inquiſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pry into the Myſteriouſneſs of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes, further than God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them to us, or that we ſhould think we ſhall be ever able to come to a compleat knowledge of any of them; for the Nature of God is ſuch a boundleſs Ocean of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſuch a Fathomleſs depth of unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Myſteries, that the cloſer thoughts of him make our Heads turn round, and diſtract and confound our Imaginations: But we ſhould with an humble Admiration adore thoſe Excellencies of his, which by our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon, or by his Holy Word, he hath been pleaſed to manifeſt to us. We ſhould, with the profoundeſt Reverence, think of, and admire the <hi>Eternity</hi> of his Being; that he always was what he now is, exquiſitely perfect, and full of himſelf, before all Ages; that he is the One only, uncreated, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Cauſe, that ſpoke all things out of nothing into their Beings, and was himſelf the only Self-exiſting one; that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Millions of Ages before the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of Time, or the remembrance of the oldeſt Angel; that did Eternally diſplay the vaſt fecundity of himſelf in the adorable Trinity; that ſhall laſt beyond all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of Time, and Power of Fate, and ſhall keep, whatever of his Creatures he pleaſes,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97801:88"/>
within the everlaſting Womb of his neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subſiſtency. We ſhould devoutly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the unconceiveable greatneſs of his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent</hi> Power, which is bounded by no force, and can ſurmount all difficulties; that can, by the leaſt Word make thouſands of New Worlds ſpring up throughout the dark Extramundan ſpaces, and can, when he pleaſes, unſpeak this again into Nothing. We muſt admire the boundleſs extent of his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that ſees all the Actions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the whole World by one Intuitive glance of his Knowledge; that from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity foreſaw every thing which was to be, with all its circumſtances and relations, when they all lay wrapt up in the Womb of a thouſand fore-running Cauſes; that dives into all the Clancular Thoughts and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mens Hearts, and knows their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions before they have determined them. We ſhould profoundly Reverence and Adore that admirable <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his Nature, which is ſo eſſentially pure and good; that there is not the leaſt ſtain in his Thoughts, the leaſt corruption or pravity in all his Actions; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is moſt exquiſitely Good and Holy; nothing but what is grounded upon the Eternal Rules of Vertue; nothing but what does exactly agree to his Infallible Judgment, and what his Eternal VViſdom
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97801:89"/>
does Judge fit to be done. VVe muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that he does not, like us, give his aſſent to what is good, but may be hinder'd from proſecuting it by a ſtubborn VVill and Diſorderly Affections; that he does not uſe unrighteous means to accompliſh his deſigns, never projects any contrivance, but what does uniformly agree with the Dictates of his moſt Rectified and All-wiſe Underſtanding. VVe ſhould likewiſe Meditate upon the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Veracity</hi> of this admirable Being; we ſhould think, that we do not worſhip ſuch a God that will cheat and deceive us, that only ſooths us up with fair words and empty promiſes, and means nothing leſs than what he tells us; that does not keep up his State like Princes of this VVorld, by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Tricks and Amuſements, or aggrandize himſelf by impoſing upon, and deluding his Creatures; but ſuch a one, whoſe Actions always agree to his Words, and his VVords always correſpond with his Mind; So that whatever God reveals to us, we may be ſure it is true; whatever he tells us is our Duty, we may be ſatisfied it is ſuch; whatever he threatens, we may be certain he will inflict; whatever he promiſes, we may be confident he will make good. <hi>Let God be True, and let every Man be a Lyar,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; that is, that God is ſo eſſentially True, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97801:89"/>
every Man be a Liar in reſpect of him; Truth is ſo interwoven in his Nature, that it is his very Being and Eſſence; it is as impoſſible for him to Lye, as it is for him not to be; as he neceſſarily is, ſo he neceſſarily is True, and we may be as certain of his Veracity, as we are of his Being. We muſt attentively conſider like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Never ſwerving <hi>Juſtice</hi> of our great Creator, who does not diſpoſe of every thing at Random, heaping his Favours upon thoſe that ſlight and deſpiſe him, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his poor Creatures, who with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obedience, to the utmoſt of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, direct their Actions according to his Laws; that does not ſuffer his Commands to be trampled upon with Impunity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo many Profligate Sinners to live all their time Blaſpheming God and Injuring Men; Preying upon the Innocent, and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning upon the Spoils of Orphans and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; that does not tamely ſuffer Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Nimrods,</hi> to Ravage the World at their Pleaſure, to wade through the Blood of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Innocents, to purchaſe their Glory; to raiſe their Fame upon the Ruins of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countries, without any pretence, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Sacrifice to their wicked Ambition; That does not ſuffer ſuch proſperous Villains, to live on in a conſtant Tyde of happineſs in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97801:90"/>
this World, and drop into the other, juſt like other Men; but does wiſely take care, that, as they have had their good things in this World, they ſhall have their evil ones in the next; and ſhall there pay ſeverely for all thoſe Inſolent Crimes which went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſht here; becauſe, perhaps, their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had raiſed them above puniſhment, or becauſe their Sins had ſwelled to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable bulk, as has made them fit Victims only for the Eternal Vengeance. So we ought to let our Minds, with the greateſt Deliciouſneſs and Satisfaction, dwell upon the Contemplation of Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is not any weak Womaniſh pity, which renders him unable to proſecute his Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Cries of ſuffering Offenders, or which will not let him puniſh even his beloved Favorites, when they deſerve it; but ſuch a wiſe Relaxation and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the ſeverity of his Juſtice, ſuch an Inclination to our Welfare and Happineſs, as puts him upon all poſſible means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming us from Miſery. We can never enough think of the Miraculous Goodneſs of this Divine Attribute, that makes God take greater Care to Preſerve and Succor us, than we can for our ſelves, and be as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to relieve us from Miſery and Oppreſſion, as we can be to be relieved; that will incline
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97801:90"/>
him to remove thoſe preſſures, which lie ſo hard upon us, and to ſuffer our Afflictions to gall and wound us no longer than they ſerve for our Benefit and Advantage; and that, if for reaſons beſt known to his All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcretion, he ſhall not withdraw his afflicting hand in this World, he will then more abundantly reach out his mercies to us in the next; when the Joys and Triumphs of that Life ſhall infinitely compenſate all the Troubles and Anxieties of this; that ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Mercy, which will deliver our Souls, as well as our Bodies, from all Calamities, which are incident to them; from all the ſpightful Temptations of Evil Angels, from the Fraud and Malice of the Devil; that will ſupport us under the direful preſſures of a wounded Spirit, and the ſharpened Stings of an accuſing Conſcience; the Contemplation of which, will give the Repenting Sinner a comfortable aſſurance of his Pardon, whileſt a Naked view of his Juſtice only will frighten en him into Diſpair and Confuſion. Now when we devoutly conſider, and meditate, as we ſhould do, upon theſe Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we cannot but Love and Admire that Wonderful Being that is the ſubject of them; and in compariſon of him, to deſpiſe all that we call Excellent in this World, which are only ſome glimmering Rays of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97801:91"/>
Beauty, which ſtream from him, the Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Fountain of Light; which are only ſome little Rills and Streams, from the Boundleſs Ocean of his Perfections.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To love God, as he is the moſt perfect Being, is, <hi>To endeavor to our utmoſt to imitate him, and act agreeably to his Nature.</hi> Whenever we have an extraordinary Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a profound Veneration, and Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and a hearty Love for any one; we endeavor to our utmoſt to imitate the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency we find in him, we make it our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to write our Lives after his Coppy, and to tranſcribe his Example into all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this is viſible, not only in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Actions of great Men, but even in the little minute Graces and Geſtures of their Body, which are greedily catched at, and taken up by their admiring Beholders. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God is ſuch a Being, in whom all imaginable Perfections do concenter, and all poſſible Excellencies do ſhine forth, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to any tolerable degree of Love and Admiration towards him, unleſs we do our utmoſt, to Coppy after ſo noble a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and to make our Actions ſuit to that ſo Divine an Original. For it is not in the leaſt probable, that ever God would have diſcovered ſo much of his Nature to us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were for our Imitation; for ſuch Ends
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97801:91"/>
as the diſplaying his own Glory, or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our Inquiſitiveneſs, are Purpoſes not half ſo Noble and Rational, as the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering us Good and Happy, by our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Him, and acting agreeably to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore when we conſider, that we worſhip a God that always was, and always will be, that is, every where, that knows all things, and can do all things; we ought to make it our Study how to render our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour ſuitable to ſo great a God. We muſt let our Lives be as vertuous as ever we can, that he may reward us; we ought to be moſt exactly circumſpect in every one of our Actions, becauſe his all ſeeing Eye is continually inſpecting us; <hi>he knows our down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitting, and our upriſing, and conſidereth our thoughts long before.</hi> 'Tis in vain to think to find any where ſuch an Umbrage for our Sins, as ſhall hide them from him; <hi>for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we fly from his Preſence?</hi> 'tis not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Retirements, and dark Receſſes that can do it; <hi>for the darkneſs is no darkneſs to him, the darkneſs and light are both alike.</hi> His vaſt unbounded Being is every where; every where, if we obey him, to ſuccour and reward us; and every where, if we diſobey him, to torment and puniſh us. He is a God that <hi>can do every thing;</hi> to whom the Winds and the Seas, and all the Powers of Nature
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97801:92"/>
obey; he can reſcue his Servants whenever he pleaſes, from the very Jaws of the Lyons; with a blaſt of his Diſpleaſure, he can ſink his Enemies into the Grave; or, with a ſtroak of his Anger, he can ſend them down quick into Hell, with all his Vengeance flaming about them. Therefore, we ſhould take diligent Care, and uſe all imaginable Caution, not to offend ſo great a God; who is endowed with ſuch a wonderful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to detect our Sins, and ſo much Power to avenge them. If God be a <hi>Pure</hi> and a <hi>Holy</hi> Being, we muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to live impure and wicked Lives; but muſt ſerve him with Holineſs and Purity; for we can never think to be acceptable Votaries to ſo Holy a Deity, to whom we be ſo utterly unlike, when we have all the Stains of our Sins about us; we can never think that that pure unſpotted Mind ſhould take Pleaſure in them, who live in ſo much Turpitude, and in ſuch a Sink of ſenſual and beaſtly Vices, as if they were Worſhippers of a Heathen <hi>Bacchus</hi> or a <hi>Flora.</hi> If he be a <hi>true</hi> God, and of infinite Veracity, then we muſt imitate his Truth, we muſt not lie and be falſe to one another, and we muſt not pay a diſſembled and hypocritical Worſhip to him, and before his all-ſearching Eyes. Seeing he is a <hi>Juſt</hi> God, we muſt have a care how we offend
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97801:92"/>
him, we muſt not ſtretch and tenter his Mercy, when we know his Juſtice is infinite too; for though his Mercy be infinite, and can never be outſinned, yet our Lives are finite, and may be ſnatched away from us; ſo that we may be never able to lay hold of his Mercy; and then we muſt be for ever delivered up to his Juſtice. If he be a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful</hi> God, we muſt have a care that we do not abuſe his Mercy, and weary out the long Suffering of God, by continually ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with our repeated Provocations; we muſt have a care too, that we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value it by a total diſpair of it; for this would be to dethrone God, and to deiſie our Sins, by making them more effectual and powerful than his Mercies, and the Merits of our Bleſſed Redeemer. Now by doing this, we ſhall demonſtrate, that we truly love God, and ſet our Affections upon him; when it appears, that we account him, of all the Beings in the World, the fitteſt to be imitated; and when we endeavor, by all poſſible means, to render our Lives conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Original, and to leave nothing in them diſorderly, and unagreeable to his moſt abſolute Perfections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To place our Affections on God, as we ought to do, We muſt love him as He is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97801:93"/>
our Benefactor, and the Author of ſo many Bleſſings to us. Which is to be done,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>By taking notice of, and conſidering the innumerable Benefits he beſtows upon us.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all the Particulars of the Divine Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, would be a Task too mighty for any one to undertake, and would ſwell up ſuch Volumes, that the World could not be able to peruſe them. For in all probability, there is not the leaſt Attom, or Particle of Matter, the leaſt Stir of natural Motion, the ſmalleſt Plant, or the minuteſt Animal, but what does contribute ſome way or other to our Happineſs and Welfare here. What admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Benefits do we receive from the Light and kind Warmth of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that paints o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and guilds the whole Univerſe with ſuch a Variety of delightful Colours, that directs our Steps, warms our Bodies, and ripens our Fruits; from the <hi>Earth,</hi> whoſe pregnant Womb brings forth every thing that is uſeful and beautiful, without which the whole World would be but like the naked Ribs of ſome ragged Rock, without any Inhabitants upon it; from the <hi>Air,</hi> every Such of which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnates our Blood with new Vivacity, and ſets this Machine of our Body a moving; from the <hi>Water,</hi> the continual Rarefaction and Condenſation of which into Miſts and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97801:93"/>
Rains, keeps up the Courſe of Life and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in all Vegetables and Animals; from the <hi>Fire,</hi> which dreſſes our Food, and comforts our Bodies, without which, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the World, would, for a long time in the Year, lie torpid and benumbed? <hi>Every Man</hi> in the Creation, either by his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, or Counſel, or Company, does ſome way contribute to the Happineſs of our Lives; for, though we ſhould poſſeſs all the World, yet how uncomfortable would it be, to be forced to do every thing we have occaſion for, our ſelves, and to walk a whole Life out mopingly alone, without Converſation? What a ſignal Mark of his Bounty is this <hi>Body</hi> we carry about us; the Contrivance of which, is ſo wonderful and beauteous? What admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Motions and Secretions are there of the Blood? What wonderful Offices of Veins and Arteries, Nerves and Muſcles, that ſometimes move on regularly for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years together, without Check or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion? How is it owing to him, that the Body is provided with the uſeful Organs, for Seeing, Speaking, Hearing, Walking, and a thouſand other Conveniencies; the loſs of which would render our Lives ſtrangely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable? What a multitudinous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is there every where by his Bounty of <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Plants, Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Fowl, Reptils</hi> and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97801:94"/>
                     <hi>Cattle;</hi> which are all ſo beautiful to our Proſpect, and ſo ſubſervient to our Uſe; and which God has wholly ſubjected to our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion? What an unſpeakable Token of his Goodneſs is it, that he has beſtowed upon us the Faculty of <hi>Reaſoning:</hi> That enables us to deduce Conſequences, to project Deſigns, to underſtand and conjecture Mens Thoughts, to treaſure up things paſt, and to provide for the future, when ſo great a part of God's Creation want theſe admirable Bleſſings, which he has ſo graciouſly beſtowed upon us. But then farther, What an immenſe largeneſs of his Almighty Bounty was it, in redeeming us from a Condition worſe than nothing, which our Sins had plunged us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; by ſending the Son of his Boſome to die for us, and to make a Propitiation for our Sins; to free us from thoſe Miſeries, to which the Lapſe of our firſt Parents, and our own Tranſgreſſions had fatally doomed us; and to entitle us to the Rewards of a bliſsful Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? This is ſuch a ſtupendious Inſtance of the Divine Beneficence, as makes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, not only <hi>deſire to pry into,</hi> but cauſes them to ſtand amazed and tranſported; when they think that God ſhould redeem the forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls of Rebellious Man, with a Ranſome of that infinite Value. Add to this the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Influxes of God's Holy Spirit; how
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97801:94"/>
he moves, inclines, perſwades, intreats, and oftentimes overpowers us into Repentance. Add further, the kind Aſſiſtances and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, which we every day experience from his particular Providence; how he keeps us from Temptations that lie enſnaring us, and from Perils and Dangers that are threatning us; how he contrives Methods for our Advantage beyond the reach of our Wiſdom, and brings about our Happineſs in ſuch degrees as are above our Hopes and Expectations. Now how can any one but love ſo good and gracious a God as this? If we find within our ſelves ſuch paſſionate Tendencies of our Souls towards the earthly Objects of our Affections; if we bear ſo much Love to a Father that begat us, or a Mother that nouriſhed us; if we feel within us ſuch a powerful Bent of our Paſſions, and ſuch an Yearning of our Souls towards our Children, which are only the Off-ſpring of our Bodies, and the Continuers of our Name and Family; to what meaſure and height ſhould our Love of God arrive, who is the Author to us of a thouſand times more and greater Benefits, and to whom we owe all thoſe other Benefits, which they only, as his Inſtruments, convey to us. O thou Great and Bountiful Being! who art therefore the more Great, becauſe the more Bountiful.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97801:95"/>
Thou mighteſt to all Eternity have lain wrapt up within thy ſelf, and for ever enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy own Happineſs, infolded within thy own Nature; thou mighteſt always have delighted thy ſelf with the Proſpect of thy own Glory, and happy by thy ſelf alone, have trodden round the endleſs Tracts of Eternity. But, O thou kind and beneficent Nature! Thy Goodneſs was ſo diffuſive, as to communicate it ſelf to a World of Beings; to raiſe out of nothing ſo many innumerable Creatures, to drink in the Gleams and Rays of thy overflowing Happineſs; to create ſo many immortal Subſtances after thy own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to make them, as far as their Nature will permit, to partake of thy own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to inſure them a Duration of it, co-extended with thy own Being. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, praiſe his holy name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>By ſhewing all the Signs, and making all ſuitable Returns we can, of a hearty Love, and a ſincere Gratitude.</hi> We muſt not love ſo great a Benefactor at a <hi>mean and a common Rate;</hi> we muſt not ſuffer our Affections towards him, to be cold, and flat, and lifeleſs; but they muſt be full of life and vigor, warmth and alacrity; our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97801:95"/>
Love muſt not only juſt keep in, but it muſt burn and flame before him; it muſt exert it ſelf in Triumphs and Exaltations of Mind, in Cordial Thankſgivings and Ardent Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We muſt not let our Affections be poſſeſſed by <hi>any thing elſe,</hi> but muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to Honors and Riches, and all the Glories of this World, when they come in competition with him, for he muſt never be Rivalled by ſuch ſordid Objects as theſe; but we muſt cry out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>there is nothing that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi> We muſt be cautious of <hi>giving him any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> or diſpleaſure, but ſhould endeavor to render our ſelves as acceptable to him as ever we can; to take advantage of all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to approve our ſelves to his liking; to ſuffer no one, if poſſibly, to ſtand more in his favor than we, but to do every thing that we can to gain his Love and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We ſhould deſire <hi>to converſe with him,</hi> as frequently as we can; we ſhould improve all opportunities to gain time to pray to him, and praiſe him; to be diligent in Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying his Law, and Reading his holy Word; to be conſtant in the Publick Offices, and in Private Exerciſes and Devotions; to take pleaſure in Pious Reflections and Meditations, and in Religious Diſcourſe. Theſe are the only ways now we can converſe with God in;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97801:96"/>
and if we truly love him, we ſhall take as much delight in this Converſation, as we do in the company of thoſe we have the greateſt kindneſs for. We muſt long <hi>to enjoy him</hi> more fully than now we do, for Love is a deſire of Union; it never reſts till it has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Centre it tends to; every thing that keeps it off from that, offers violence to it; and therefore we ought to wiſh, that this dark Curtain of Life were drawn up, which hinders us from looking into the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual World; that this Groſs Medium of Fleſh and Blood, through which our Souls now look, were changed for the Spiritual Body; and that we were let into that State, where we ſhall no longer <hi>ſee through a Glaſs darkly, but ſhall ſee God face to face;</hi> we ſhould long till theſe days of our Pilgrimage are over, and <hi>deſire,</hi> with <hi>St. Paul, to be diſſolved, and to be with Christ.</hi> So likewiſe, to love him is <hi>readily to obey his commands;</hi> for when we have a hearty kindneſs for him, we can never trample upon thoſe Sacred Laws which he has given us; we can never refuſe to comply with thoſe Precepts which he has commanded us; we can never complain of the hardſhip of thoſe injunctions he has laid upon us, or do them ſluggiſhly and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but ſhall ſtrive, with all alacrity, to be the forwardeſt to fulfil his Pleaſure;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97801:96"/>
we ſhould be proud of the opportunity we have of doing any thing for him; we ſhould take it as a mighty favour, that he would be pleaſed to Honour us ſo far, as to lay his Commands upon us; and ſhould moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obey him, altho' we expected no other Reward, but only the Honour of his having employed us. After this manner we act, in our Demeanor to them whom we ſincerely love; and we are apt to ſuſpect the Love of any one, whom we find deficient in any of theſe particulars, and therefore we can never arrive to the true excellency of the Spiritual and Divine Love, unleſs we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all that is before preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But you will ſay, that you think you other ways lead a Godly and a Chriſtian Life; that you do all the Good, and avoid all the Evil you can; but you cannot find that you Love God with that earneſtneſs and feelingneſs that ſome do; that you never Experience that Rapturouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Devotion, ſuch heated Paſſions, and ſuch an exundant Zeal, which animate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do things in a manner extraordinary, for the Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To this I anſwer, 1ſt. That thoſe who obey all Gods Commands, do love him
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97801:97"/>
as they ought, becauſe the loving him is one of his Commands; and becauſe the love of God does in great meaſure conſiſt in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commands. <hi>He that hath my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and keepeth them, he it is that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me,</hi> Joh. 14.21. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3. And beſides, the loving God with all our Hearts, and above all things, our conſtant Praying to him, and Praiſing him, (which are the great parts of the Divine Love) are Duties commanded us in Scripture; and therefore we cannot keep his Commands, without performing theſe. But as for ſome elevated hights and raptures in Devotion, ſome over boilings of Zeal for Gods Honour, they are generally the effect of Mens bodily Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; and to make theſe abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, is only to open Heaven Gates to People of juſt ſuch a Complexion. 2dly. There are different degrees in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life; there is a <hi>Salvable State,</hi> and a <hi>State of Heroick Piety;</hi> ſo that Men of the firſt Rank may be content only to go on in the Common high Road of Vertue, which does not require any of the ſublimated Love of the Heroick Soul; but the other muſt ſcrew up their Affections to a higher pitch, muſt refine themſelves more into the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Nature, and give themſelves a fore-taſte
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97801:97"/>
of the Joys of the other World in this. And I doubt not, but many good Men, if they would endeavour to their utmoſt, to make all the Advances they can in Piety, they would ſoon diſcover that thoſe heights and raptures, which are ſo diſcourſed of in the Deſcriptions of the <hi>Spiritual Love,</hi> have not ſo much of the Enthuſiaſt in them as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; For I could never be brought over to that Opinion of the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> That the loving God is only a bare keeping his Commands; that God is to be loved only as a <hi>Legiſlator,</hi> which is by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; that if we do but obey him, 'tis no matter tho' it be only the fear of his Puniſhments that drives us to it; that our Obedience to him, upon account only of fear, is as Noble and as acceptable to him as that upon the ſcore of Love; becauſe Fear, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, is one of the two Principles of our Obedience, which he has eſtabliſhed. But this is ſuch a poor and a flat Notion of the Divine Love, that I wonder any one, who had read the Noble Writings of that Divineſt of the Apoſtles St. <hi>John,</hi> could ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch mean and pitiful thoughts of that Heavenly Paſſion which he does ſo every where recommend. For can we ever think that the love of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> which was ſo much applauded by our Saviour, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97801:98"/>
a bare cold Obedience to his Commands; that that paſſionate Expoſtulation with St. <hi>Peter, Simon Son of Jonas loveſt thou me?</hi> was nothing elſe but a commanding him to feed his Sheep, and that perhaps out of fear only? How ſhould ever a Compliance with God's Will, out of fear of his Puniſhments, be as acceptable to him, as an Obedience, which proceeds from the generous Principle of Love? For the Apoſtle tells us expreſly, that <hi>Perfect Love caſteth out Fear, becauſe fear hath torment: he that feareth is not made perfect in Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. A Man may <hi>begin</hi> the Spiritual Life upon the Principle of Fear, but, to make it <hi>perfect,</hi> he muſt be wrought upon by Love: The Fears of everlaſting Torments may ſcare a Man from going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Hell; but there muſt be ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Love, to conduct him to the Gates of Heaven. But to make an Obedience to the Divine Will, from the Compulſion of Fear, as noble and as well-pleaſing to God, as one that proceeds from a Love of his Goodneſs, is as abſurd, as to ſay, that the willing Obedience of a dutiful Son, and the frank Services of a faithful Friend, are not more generous and brave, than the forced Cringes and Crouches of a Slave, or a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:97801:98"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To contemn the World as we ſhould do, We muſt place our Affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Joys which God has promiſed us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Which is to be done,</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">In believing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother State.</note> 
                     <hi>By heartily believing all that God has promiſed of them.</hi> We can never ſet our Affections upon that, which we do not ſtedfaſtly believe; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Will nor the Affections can tend to what is conceived impoſſible. A Man may indeed give a random Wiſh, for that which is never likely to come to paſs; but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rationally, and upon ſerious Thoughts, be in love with ſuch a Fancy. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can thoroughly place our Affections upon the Heavenly Joys, we muſt fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Reality of them; and that they are of that Greatneſs and Duration as they are repreſented. We muſt be throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that God has not made ſo noble a Creature as Man, to partake only of the groſs Pleaſures of this World; that he has not implanted in him ſuch an earneſt deſire of Immortality, on purpoſe to delude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; that he will not permit good Men to ſuffer ſo many Calamities in this World, and either to fall to nothing, or to go unrewarded in the next; that our Bleſſed Saviour, by the Merits of his Croſs, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97801:99"/>
Interceſſion with the Father, has purchaſed us an <hi>eternal weight of Glory;</hi> that if we perform the Conditions of that Covenant, which he hath made with God for us, and which is exhibited to us in the Goſpel; we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be Partakers of that bleſſed State of Immortality, which is there promiſed; that theſe Joys are not the Dreams of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Enthuſiaſtical People, but ſuch as ſhall certainly come to paſs; that we have as much an aſſurance of them, as we can have of any thing that is future, as being confirmed by ſuch infallible and divine Proofs, as will command every ones Belief; unleſs we could be perſuaded, that God would ever lend his own Miraculous Power for the Confirmation of Lies and Impoſtures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Meditating upon it.</note>Secondly, <hi>By diligently Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Meditating upon the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Eternity of theſe Joys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Enjoyments of the other World are ſo remote from us, and of ſuch a kind, as our Nature is but little acquainted with; and moreover, worldly Objects are ſo continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtriking upon our Senſes, and gratifying them for the preſent, that unleſs we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give our ſelves to a ſerious Meditation of the Happineſs of another Life, they will be as little apt to have an Influence upon us, as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97801:99"/>
if we knew nothing, or believed nothing of them. Which is the reaſon why many care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconſidering Chriſtians do live as wicked and diſſolute Lives as any Atheiſts and Infidels in the World. We ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that Heaven is ſuch a State of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where we ſhall be freed from all the <hi>Troubles and Anxieties,</hi> which do ſo much diſquiet this Life of ours; where <hi>all Tears ſtall be wiped from our Eyes,</hi> where we ſhall have no more ſad Tryals and Perſecutions, no more Pains and Sickneſſes, no more Griefs and Diſcontents, no more Delays and Diſappointments, no more Doubts and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, no more Errors and Miſconſtructions, no more peeviſh Conteſts and Quarrels; where there ſhall be nothing to croſs our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, or diſappoint our Deſires, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give us the leaſt Vexation or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. We ſhould frequently bethink our ſelves, that we ſhall then <hi>converſe with all the glorious Hierarchy of Heaven,</hi> with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bleſſed Saints and Angels, with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Patriarchs and Prophets, Apoſtles and Martyrs; with ſo many thouſands of happy Saints that have died in the Lord; all which have Minds repleniſhed to amazement with Divine Knowledge, and brim full of Love and Charity. Now if it be ſo delightſome to us, to Conſort with our dear Friends,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97801:100"/>
with the moſt knowing and pleaſant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if we be ſo taken with that little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Diverſion they can give us; how muſt our Joy abound, to aſſociate our ſelves with ſuch Angelick and Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that are ſo profoundly knowing in the eternal and myſterious Truths of the Deity, that have in them all the raviſhing Arts of Indearment; to behold their unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls, and glorified Bodies, to joyn in the melodious Conſort of their Heavenly Anthems, and with them to ſing everlaſting Praiſes and Hallelujahs? How ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to behold the glorified Body of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer, which was ſeen in this World in Contempt and Poverty; but ſhall there be exalted to the greateſt Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and ſhall ſhine forth ten thouſand times brighter than the Sun in his Meridian Glory? We ſhall then be let in to a <hi>cloſer View of the Eſſence of God,</hi> and to a nearer Knowledge of the All-great Triune Deity, that inexhauſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stock of Myſteries; in the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which, the loftieſt Cherubims loſe themſelves, and have their Thoughts drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the unfathomable Abyſs. We ſhould think, how we are then to be compleatly Happy, both Body and Soul, which ſhall each of them enjoy more Pleaſure than they can deſire, or can wiſh for. When we ſhall
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97801:100"/>
be array'd in a Body more ſtrong and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the firmeſt Adamant, more agil than the nimble Light, more beautiful and glorious than the Sun it ſelf. When our Souls ſhall be endowed with an unconceivable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of knowing, when our Underſtandings ſhall be continually fed with the knowledge of the moſt deſirable Truths, when the Godhead ſhall be always more and more revealing and unfolding his Nature to us, and we for ever more and more tranſcribing the delightful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations; when our Wills and Affections ſhall be fully ſatisfied by enjoying God, the greateſt and ſublimeſt Good; when our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies too, ſhall enjoy Pleaſures ſuitable to their ſpiritualized Nature; when in ſhort, we ſhall have all our Appetites ſatisfied to the Brim, without being cloy'd; when our Enjoyments ſhall outrun our very Deſires; when we ſhall experience more Pleaſure in the Fruition, than we could hope for in our Expectation. 'Tis in vain further to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deſcribe an inexpreſſible State of Glory; for when all is ſaid that can be ſaid, all the nobleſt Metaphors and Illuſtrations, which Rhetorick can afford, or a luxuriant Fancy produce, all will be ſtill flat and low in reſpect of the Mighty Subject; nay, that all will be no more than what the Apoſtle has ſaid in a Word: <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97801:101"/>
hath heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> But yet there is one thing we ſhould conſider further, a thing that doubles and trebles, nay, that infinitely enhanſes all the other Happineſs, and adds more to it, than if all the Atoms of the whole Univerſe were added to one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Unity: I mean the Eternity of it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity! Eternity! a Word big with Wonder and Amazement. An indefectible Preſent; an unalterable Now; a Time that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beginning, and never ending; that ſhall be as far from expiring ten Millions of Years hence, as it is at this Moment. Any thing that is Eternal, is worth every thing that is Temporal. For there is no Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between them. The Duration of the one does infinitely ſurpaſs the Greatneſs of the other. Were I but to enjoy the Pleaſure I feel now in this delightful Contemplation for ever, for ever! Oh it would be a fooliſh Exchange, to take in liew of it the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of theſe Kingdoms, though it were to the end of the World. What ſay we then to an Eternity of vaſt unſpeakable Pleaſures, that we are to enjoy in the other World? It ſhould certainly methinks make us deſpiſe all the poor, little, ſhortliv'd things in this: or ſurely, one would ſuppoſe, no one could
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97801:101"/>
be ſo ſilly to forfeit his Intereſt in ſuch an eternal Inheritance, for ſome momentany Trifle here, for the Miſers little Gain, or the Voluptuaries Senſuality. I am ſure <hi>Eſau</hi>'s parting with his Birth-right for a Meſs of Pottage, and <hi>Mark Antony</hi>'s loſing the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a Victory for a Miſtreſs, was a conſiderable Point of Reaſon and Prudence to ſuch an egregious piece of Folly and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity as this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In earneſtly deſiring, and longing for this Happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly this is the natural Reſult of the two former Conſiderations; for if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and conſider the Greatneſs of thoſe Joys, we cannot if we would, hinder our deſiring and longing for them. For there is ſuch a Magnetick, Attractive Force in the Heavenly Joys, towards thoſe that devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplate them; that a Man can as ſoon hate himſelf, and be out of Love with his own Happineſs, as not to long for ſuch Joys that promiſe ſuch raviſhing Pleaſure. Therefore, when we think of the other World, we muſt let all our Affections lie centered there, and think every Minute of our Life adds to our Unhappineſs, that keeps us out from it. We ſhould think it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Souls are diſcharged from this dark
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97801:102"/>
Dungeon of Clay, before they are delivered from theſe Clogs and Fetters of Fleſh and Blood; before they are manumitted and ſet free into the Intellectual World, and never more to undergo ſuch a deplorable Bondage. We ſhould wiſh that our tediious and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Voyage were at an end, that we might ſee no more thoſe boiſterous Storms we meet with here, that we could but ſafely land that rich Lading we are fraighted with, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive ſecurely at the bleſſed Haven of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. We ſhould be perfectly impatient till this State of our Probation were over, that we might have no more Doubts and Fears of our Miſcarriage, but that we might enter upon an actual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Happineſs we aſpire to. We ſhould eagerly deſire, that our Race we are running were finiſhed, that we were ſecure of the Prize we are contending for, that we had the Crown upon our Heads we have been ſo long waiting for; and we ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem every thing that retards that our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Happineſs, as moſt unlucky and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to us.</p>

                     <p>The Pleaſures of this World ought eo be Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe they are common to Evil Men, as well as to Good.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHEN we ſee Riches and Honors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> poſſeſſed by Evil Men, as well as Good, it ſhould methinks take off the Edge of our Appetite to them, by conſidering that ſuch baſe and ſenſual Men have the moſt to do with them that they have the greateſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97801:103"/>
Share of the good Things of this World, who are the declared Enemies of God, and all Good Men. Now if we account every thing to loſe proportionably of its Value, as it is common to baſe and ignoble People, if we diſdain to imitate our Enemies in any thing they do; then, with how great a Scorn ſhould we look down upon all the Glories of this World, which are poſſeſſed by Men, whom Vice has debaſed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Contempt: With what a diſdainful Eye ſhould we behold them, when they are uſed by thoſe that are avowed Enemies to our Great Creator, and are of ſuch different Principles and Practices from us? So again, Methinks any reaſonable Man ſhould think fit to deſpiſe That, which God, the wiſeſt of all rational Beings, does think fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue. Now we find, that God ſets ſo little Eſteem upon the Pleaſures of this World, that he ſuffers his greateſt Enemies quietly to enjoy them; he thinks it not worth his while to put them out of Poſſeſſion of them in this Life; he reckons them ſuch inconſiderable Trifles, and to be enjoyed for ſo ſhort a time, that it is beneath the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Providence, to adjuſt the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them here; eſpecially when they are to pay ſo dearly for their Sins hereafter. Therefore, unleſs we think our ſelves wiſer
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97801:104"/>
than God, we ſhould think them little and inconſiderable too; and ſhould conclude, they are not Noble enough to ſet our Hearts upon, when the Providence of God, that (as the Scripture tells us) takes notice of Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and the Hairs of our Head, does hardly vouchſafe a Cognizance of them. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, When we ſee ſuch great Honors, and vaſt Eſtates poſſeſſed by wicked Men, and ſo many of God's deareſt Saints lying in the moſt forlorn State of Poverty; it ſhould ſtrangely leſſen our Eſteem of thoſe things, which God ſeems purpoſely to keep away from his beſt Servants. For God generally has another ſort of Diſcipline for Good Men to go through in this World, Hardſhips and Trouble, Care and Afflictions, or Want and Poverty. <hi>If any Man</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>will be my Diſciple, let him take up his Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</hi> That is, if any Man will be my Diſciple, he muſt partake of my Croſs; if he will fight under my Banner, he muſt drink of my Cup; but if he be ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and delicate, that he cannot down with Afflictions, he is no fit Follower of me, the perſecuted Jeſus, who am <hi>a Man of Sorrows, and acquainsed with Grief;</hi> my Religon does not entitle Men to Beds of Down and Ivory, when I my ſelf <hi>have not where to lay my head.</hi> And the Apoſtle reads us juſt the ſame
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97801:104"/>
Lecture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>If you endure chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then God dealeth with you as with Sons; for what Son is he, whom the Father chaſteneth not? But if ye be without Chaſtiſement, whereof all are Partakers, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons.</hi> And upon this account it was, that ſeveral pious Chriſtians of old time, having found themſelves to have enjoyed a very great ſhare of the Happineſs of this World, have prayed to God, that he would be pleaſed to viſit them with ſome Affliction or other, that might ſomewhat abate their uninterrupted Proſperity, leaſt ſuch a conſtant Tide of Worldly Happineſs ſhould preclude them from God's Favour, and be a Bar to their Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Grace. Now, though I will not affirm, that Riches and Honours, and other Pleaſures of this World are Things to be prayed againſt, or that Afflictions are to be deſired; yet theſe laſt are ſuch uſual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of Piety, that, when a Man finds himſelf carried on in a conſtant Series of Proſperity, without any mixture of Croſſes and Troubles, it will be apt to make him miſtruſt his Condition, and raiſe ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings within him, that he is not among the Number of God's Children, upon whom the Goſpel does entail ſo many Calamities and Sufferings. And therefore certainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very prudent Chriſtian will retain but little
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97801:105"/>
Eſteem and Love for thoſe things which may put his Soul to ſo much Hazzard, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo great a Diſtruſt of his future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>We ought to contemn this World, berauſe the Pleaſures of it are ſo uncertain.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOthing is truly valuable, the Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which is not aſcertained to us, and the end of which we are ſhortly like to ſee. And this is the reaſon, as I obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why Eternity was the moſt ineſtimable thing that could be, becauſe it has that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of continuing always. Now this Truth is likwiſe confirmed by the common Judgment and Opinion of all Mankind, who for this reaſon eſteem a Great Man himſelf happier, than thoſe who are about him, and converſe with him; for though they often have as pleaſant a View of his ſtately Houſe and coſtly Furniture, and do frequently par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all the Delicacies of his Table, yet this is but now and then, or as long as he pleaſes; whileſt he is ſuppoſed to have the Enjoyment of them for his Life, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controul. Now the Pleaſures of this World are ſo very uncertain, and we can
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97801:105"/>
depend upon them to little; that to ſet a mighty value upon them for our ſhort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious poſſeſſion of them, is as Ridiculous as for a Man to pride himſelf upon his now and then Dining at Court, or his Walking in the Park; as much or more, than if he were the Great Lord and Owner of them both. For really there are none of all the Gay pleaſures, which Men are ſo Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with; but are as uncertain, as ever the Wheels of Fortune can make them. To give but an inſtance or two, one would think, that a <hi>Large Eſtate</hi> were too big a thing, to be whisked away after Fortunes Chariot; and yet the ſeems to be more humorſom in nothing, than in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of theſe. We make indeed a great buſtle to get an Eſtate, which we think will perpetuate our Name and Family; we pretend that we buy it for ever, but there is never a greater Soleciſm in our Language, and we are never more miſerably deceiv'd, than in this. For there is not one Eſtate in forty, that directly continues in the ſame Family, it was in King <hi>James</hi> the I's time, which is not threeſcore and ten years ago; and for ought I know, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this ſpot of ground, I now tread upon, ſince the Conqueſt, which is not much above <hi>five</hi> hundred years, may have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97801:106"/>
had <hi>one</hi> hundred Owners. But alaſs! an Eſtate is ſo far from being apt to continue in a Family, that it often leaves us before we die. How many brave flouriſhing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates have been loſt only by Eſpouſing a Weaker Faction in the State; and have in an inſtant been ſwallowed up in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Booty? How many have been decayed and loſt by the Calamities and Charges of Wars, how many by providing for a great Number of Children, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by the Miſcarriage of them, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by unexpected Loſſes, how many by ill Titles, and how many more by the Riot and Luxury of the Owners? So that, he that looks upon an Eſtate, as a certain thing, may with more ſenſe think the Wind and the Weather ſo. For theſe, tho' they are very variable; yet they have their Viciſſitudes, and turn about to the ſame Point again; but an Eſtate once gone from us, is never likely to return. And ſo it happens in the caſe of <hi>Honour,</hi> which is one of the moſt uncertain fickle things we can poſſeſs. Let a Man but once loſe his Eſtate, and his Honour will be too poor a thing to ſupport it ſelf. Every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will ſlight and deſpiſe ſuch indigent Dignity: A neceſſitous Lord grows cheap and contemptible to a Wealthy Ale-Houſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97801:106"/>
keeper. How many great <hi>Sejanus</hi>'s have we ſeen, that whilſt they have kept their Princes Favour, have had the Knees and Tongues of half the Nation at their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom their Flatterers have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Deified and Adored; when they have no ſooner fell into Diſgrace with their Prince, but their Honour has ſeem'd Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified in the Noſtrils of Men; who have at laſt vilified and affronted them more, than they ever before Reſpected them? What Fame is ſo Bright, which is not to be ſullied by the Defamatory Tongues of malicious Men? The Regal Honour is the greateſt, and the leaſt liable to diminution, becauſe the Vulgar are apt naturally to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire ſuch greatneſs, and not to ſee or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Faults, in the midſt of ſo much Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; and yet we have known that the beſt perhaps of Kings, that was a Glory to the Diadem, loſt his Honour with the greateſt part of his Subjects, by the virulent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and malicious Inſinuations of ſome few Republican Spirits, who lied him, as much as in them lay, both out of his Life and Innocency. Again, what a variable thing is Beauty, which ſo many admire in others, and are Proud of in themſelves? The beſt Face cannot be inſured againſt the ſmall Pox only; Nay, twenty other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97801:107"/>
will turn the moſt Celebrated Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into a Spectacle of another kind. Or if neither of theſe chance to do it, Age will do it effectually; and there is not much of Age required neither; for the loſs of Beauty is ordinarily ſurvived thirty or forty years; therefore, all ſuch ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious how they Value themſelves over much upon that, which they may poſſeſs <hi>ten</hi> years, but if they live out their time, they muſt be without <hi>forty.</hi>

                     <p>The Pleaſures of this World ought to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, becauſe they are in themſelves Vain and Inconſiderable.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS for that great Pleaſure of being <hi>Rich,</hi> it is really one of the greateſt Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for tho Wealth be well uſed by ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as handſomly as one can; yet, if we conſider, it makes a Man as Ridiculous as <hi>Senecto Grandio,</hi> whom <hi>Seneca</hi> ſo Laughs at in his Controverſies; That would have his Servants, his Plate, his Victuals and Shoes, his Miſtreſs and all of an hugeous Size. So a Rich Man muſt have a great Houſe, a great many Servants, a great deal of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, a great deal of Company, a great
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97801:107"/>
deal of Formality, and a great deal of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency; when one quarter of any of it, and none of ſome of it would do far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. There is no doubt ſuch a thing as true <hi>Honour</hi> in the World, that is the juſt praiſe Men attain for their Vertue and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; but that which is generally Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch, and which moſt Men aim at, is one of the Vaineſt things in Nature. What a buſineſs is a Great Swelling Title, for a Man to Pride himſelf upon? They are juſt ſo many Words or Names, which will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make a Man Wiſer nor better. They are ſuch, as an Herald can produce an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them in an hour; and ſuch as the poor Barbarous people out do us in; for the Style of a little Petty Prince, in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> out-ſwaggers the Medals of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. I am apt to think, that an Old Greek or Roman who knew no Honour but what followed the Office, would have Laughed heartily, to have ſeen our Modern Liſts of Nobility; to Read of Barons and Counts, Marquiſſes and Dukes of ſuch Places, where perhaps, they have not one Foot of Land, or one jot of Intereſt. Theſe Titles, 'tis True, are Marks of Diſtinction, which the Supreme Magiſtrate in every Nation gives forth, to ſhew what place each one ſhould take in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97801:108"/>
the Common Wealth, and every one is obliged to maintain, and to give place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; but to think, that there is more than this in theſe Titles; or that they do confer a real Worth, where there is none before; or to behave our ſelves haughtily, upon this Account; is only to be Proud of bare <hi>Fiocco</hi>'s and Feathers. And ſo again, as for that All-Glorious thing called <hi>Fame,</hi> that great Bait for Ambitious Spirits; it is too pitiful a thing, to be Courted at ſo paſſionate a Rate. Obſcurity and the not being taken Notice of is a thing which moſt Men mortally hate; but it is, becauſe they do not enough conſider its advantages But be that as it will, yet what Advantage does a Man get by being much Talked of, and much ſtared at; by being much admired and praiſed by ſome, and much cenſured by others? Could we Arrive to all the Fame we aim at, it would be but a ſilly thing, when it was attained; but not the thouſand part of thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be Famous, ever could be ſo. There are not much above half a Score Names, of ſo many Millions of People that lived in the Heathen World, that are really Famous now, and are in every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Mouths; ſuch as the Authors of two or three Philoſophical Sects, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97801:108"/>
Plato</hi> and <hi>Epicurus;</hi> or ſome Great Warriors, as <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the like; and theſe are known only by the ſound of the Names, and, nothing elſe to moſt people; but all the other Multitude of Antiquity are either totally loſt in their Graves, or ſome few of them known only by ſome Bookiſh Men. Nay, if a Man has only a Deſign upon Fame, as long as he lives, it is but a very little Portion of it, which he is like to get. For a Man ſhould conſider, that there are ſo many Men in the World, that every Body is not like to know every Body. The Chief Miniſter of State in <hi>France</hi> is not I believe Perſonally known to the thouſandth part of that Kingdom, nor by his Name to an hundreth part of this; and yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions of Men are there, that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver likely to be a quarter ſo Famous as Monſieur <hi>Pompone.</hi> The Nobility of the Nation and the Prime Officers at Court are thoſe, that are the moſt Famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and yet they are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by ſo much as their Titles to the greateſt part of the Nation; and to the reſt moſtly by Liſts and by Hearſay. One that makes a very great Figure among us here, is never heard of perhaps in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> or <hi>Denmark.</hi> But if Fame conſiſts only
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97801:109"/>
in being known and admired; then our Mountebanks and Players are the famouſeſt Men in all the Kingdom; and therefore 'tis hardly worth any Wiſe Man's while, to ſeek after that which the Refuſe of the Kingdom can ſo eaſily attain to. Well, but is not Fame after Death a Noble Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe? Why, truly I think but an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one for a Chriſtian to trouble himſelf about; who expects ſome other Pleaſures after Death, than the being talked of. The Heathens 'tis true, were very fond of this, a <hi>Volito clara per ora Virum</hi> was all they had to comfort them againſt the fears of Death, when they wanted the Revelation of another State; but they are in ſome meaſure to be excuſed, becauſe they found within themſelves an impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſire of Immortality, and could not eaſily ſee any other way to effect it, but only by this. But for us Chriſtians, to de, ſpiſe the Joys of Paradiſe for the clattering of peoples Tongues, is an unpardonable Affront offer'd to our Religion; it is a worſe Indignity put upon God, than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> longing for Garlick and Onions, when they fed upon the Food of Angels. But waving this Argument, what good does Fame after Death do any Man? I will inſtance in the moſt famous Man of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:97801:109"/>
all Antiquity, I mean <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for as for <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I look upon them to be infamouſly ſo, far beneath that Wretch that burnt the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Temple; two bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Butchers of Mankind, that cut the Throats of ſo many Innocent People, to Sacrifice to their Wicked Ambition. I ſay, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he that was Tutor (if that be any Fame) to the greateſt Conqueror in the World; that had the moſt Univerſal Genius of all the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> that brought Philoſophy into ſome Method and Intelligibleneſs, which was Cant and Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon before; that was, I may ſay, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of Logick, that Great Pillar of Reaſon; that was ſo admirable a Critick in Poetry, that both <hi>Epick</hi> and <hi>Lyrick,</hi> as well as the <hi>Drammaticks</hi> will ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him Eternally; that gave the moſt admirable Rules in Rhetorick, which ever the World had, or I dare ſay ever ſhall have; that wrote ſuch a Syſtem of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as was never equalled, till the Sermon upon the Mount; whoſe Phyſiology was better than the beſt of his Time, and will ſtill be in Reputation and Requeſt, when the <hi>Carteſius</hi>'s and <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>'s ſhall not be heard of; whoſe Heterodoxies in Divinity are better defended, than other Mens Truths; whoſe Books have been Read ten
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97801:110"/>
thouſand times over, and as many Volumes of Comments Wrote or Printed upon them; who was almoſt the only Study of Learned Men for many Ages, whoſe Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are taken, in moſt Controverſies, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Axioms, and are defended every day in moſt of the famous Schools of <hi>Europe;</hi> to whom we are obliged for our uſual diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Terms of Art in our ordinary Diſcourſe, ſuch as <hi>Material, Formal, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Object,</hi> &amp;c. which were firſt of his Coyning: I ſay <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that has all this Fame entailed upon him, can receive no Benefit from it after Death. If he be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, he has ſomething better to buſie his thoughts about; or, if he be miſerable it will not relieve him. If he has ceaſed to be, he knows nothing of it now; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, he could never have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it. So that in ſhort, as to all the good this Fame can have done this great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, ſince his Death; he had e'en as good have been, <hi>Cleanthes, Speuſippus, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> or <hi>Corneades,</hi> for whom we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to other Authors, that we know any thing of.</p>
                  <p>Next, as to the ſenſual Pleaſures of this World, that Men run with ſo great a Guſt and impetus to; they are all of them ſo vain and inconſiderable in themſelves; that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97801:110"/>
one would Wonder, that ever Men could be ſo fooliſh, to put their Souls to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite hazard, for ſuch Trifles. For moſt of the greateſt Pleaſures, we can enjoy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to no more, than the freeing us from ſome indiſpoſition, and bringing to a State of Indolence or want of Pain. What is the Pleaſure of Eating and Drinking, but only the aſſwaging the Uneaſineſs of our Hunger and Thirſt; which when they are over, the Pleaſure is gone? What is all the delight of our uſual Sports and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, but only ſome Artificial Methods, to paſs away the Tedious Minutes of our uncomfortable Time? Nay, as for thoſe Pleaſures, which ſeem to have more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs in their Nature, they are all ſo Fleeting and Vaniſhing; that we have loſt them, before we can be well ſaid, to have them.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Pleaſures of this World ought to be contemned, becauſe they are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOW the Pleaſures of this World are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſatisfying</hi> upon theſe Three Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are not the True Good of the Soul. Now the Nature of the Soul, as of every thing elſe, can never be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but with that which is, or which tends to its own Good. We may indeed delude it and put Tricks upon it, and quiet its Appetite for ſome time; but its Deſires will ſtill ſpring up a freſh, and will be fully ſatisfied with nothing, but what tends to its true Happineſs and Perfection. Thus we ſee a great number of Men live on jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily as they ſuppoſe, in an eager purſuit of ſenſual Pleaſures; and think by them to gratifie that impatient deſire of Happineſs, they find their Souls always to retain; but when ever they give themſelves leave to think, they perceive their Minds to recoil upon them; they feel thoſe Enjoyments they have glutted them with, ſit uneaſie on them; they find, that theſe fleſhy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97801:111"/>
are no fit Food for the Soul, that the more we cram her with theſe ſort of Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the more we ſtarve her. For in good reality we may as well think, to ſatisfie our Stomachs with Stones and Pebbles, as our Souls with Riot and Luxury; we may as well try to Nouriſh our Bodies with Arguments and Notions, as our Minds with Eating and Drinking. We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by long Cuſtom bring our Soul into ſuch a Diſeaſe, as to think this Traſh more Palatable than at firſt; but we can never make it ſo natural to her, but that ſhe muſt ſometime diſlike it, eſpecially when ſhe finds it is like to Ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her. So that if we would have true ſatisfaction in this World, we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſatisfie our <hi>Souls,</hi> which are truly <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> and that is, by a Courſe of Vertue and the Study of knowledg; but without theſe, let us door poſſeſs what we will, we ſhall be miſerable, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glut of Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Pleaſures of this World are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying, becauſe they promiſe more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, than they can give. I know not upon what Account it is, whither that Mens Judgments are blinded by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Devil, or by the Impetuoſity of their own Deſires; that they always
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97801:112"/>
fancy there is more Enjoyment in any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſure, than they find to be. But I appeal to the Experience of all Men, if it be not ſo. With what impatience doth the young Heir wait for the Eſtate he is Intituled to? How doth he long to be freed from the Yoke of Parents and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? What Pleaſure does he cut out for himſelf, in the full Poſſeſſion of ſo large a Fortune? But when the Good Old Parent is gone to his Fathers, and the Impatient Succeſſor has poſſeſſed his Place, he finds his condition altered not one jot for the better; and he perceives now at laſt, that he muſt undergo the trouble alſo of that Eſtate, all the Pleaſures of which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd before. What ſtrange Ideas of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs does the eager Competitor for a Preferment raiſe in his Brain, what Wealth and Honour, what Pleaſure and ſatisfaction does he promiſe to himſelf, if he can but ſucceed in his deſign? And when he does ſucceed, how flatly doth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing Anſwer his expectation, how or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary do thoſe fancied joys appear, and how doth he find himſelf not at all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, than before his Competition? It is needleſs to give more inſtances for this Truth, becauſe all Men are convinced of it: And therefore it is matter of Wonder,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97801:112"/>
that they do not, with joynt conſent, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and deſpiſe thoſe Pleaſures, which put ſuch an apparent Cheat upon all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are Unſatisfying as they have much Evil or Sorrow mixed with them.</p>
                  <p>Men may be apt to think, that there is no Happineſs like the <hi>Regal Glory,</hi> that no Joys on this ſide Heaven, are like thoſe of the Glittering Diadem; but alaſs! they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſider, what a Pain it is to have the Cares of a whole Nation in one breaſt; to have ones Patience Racked and Tente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by unwelcom Petitions, to have ones Quiet every Minute diſturbed by importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Addreſſes; to be forced againſt ones Stomach upon conſtant buſineſs; to be ſo full of Caution and Dread, of treading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtep awry; to be continually thinking, how to balm up differences in State, and to reconcile contrary Factions; how to appeaſe Enemies, and to gain Friends; in ſhort, how to manage, and how to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ſo many thouſand Peeviſh and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Spirits. <hi>Places of Honour</hi> are dazling things to look upon, and which all Ambitious Men deſire; but then they do not conſider the variableneſs and danger of them, that ſuch Great Men, as they are high, they are always tottering; that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97801:113"/>
then Envy is continually ready to trip up their Heels: and that their Elevation will but make their fall the Heavier. <hi>Riches</hi> indeed are things, which all Men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, Courtiers a begging, Church-men ſoliciting, and Tradeſmen a getting; but let a Man caſt up all the Trouble he muſt take along with them; the Pains in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing them, rhe Care in keeping them, and the Vexation he may have in loſing them; and at length he will find, that he ſhall not be much the happier for them. Let the diſſolute <hi>Voluptuary,</hi> that thinks he engroſſes all the Joys of the World to himſelf, and drinks full Draughts of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed Pleaſures; that deſpiſes all thoſe Melancholy Religious, that think there is any other ſatisfaction, beſides his <hi>Vive hodie;</hi> let him but compute how much Tireſomneſs there is in a diſſolute Courſe of Life, how much Sickneſs is undergone by repeated Debauches, what a ſink of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a Man's Body is made by a Habit of Lewdneſs; and then let him ſpeak of the great Pleaſures of ſuch a Life.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Pleaſures of this World are to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe they are Cloying and Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere is no Pleaſure truly valuable but what we may take a full draught of, and which our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite will ſerve us to enjoy over and over; but the Pleaſures of this World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cloy us at the firſt Taſt; and we grow more weary of them afterwards, than we were deſirous of them before. And this is</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe we quickly find an end of all the ſatisfaction they can afford us. There is no Infinite to be found here, no inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible ſtock of Pleaſures, which can never be enjoyed over; but only ſome poor puny ones, thin, ſtuck about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Object; which the greedy Appetite ſwallows immediately, and then the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is gone. We find ſo little in them at firſt, that it is nauſeous to go over them again; they may ſerve a little to divert us once or twice, but we are ſurfeited with them afterward. We are forced to uſe a great deal of Art, you ſee, to take any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97801:114"/>
Pleaſure in a delicate way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; we muſt chop and change our Diſhes every day, to make our Palats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh even thoſe ſtudied Delicacies. The Pleaſure of a new purchaſed Honour, is no more than that of a New Suit of Cloaths, 'tis gone after one days wearing. The ſatisfaction we take in a New Built Houſe is vaniſhed as ſoon as it is finiſhed. In ſhort, all the Pleaſures of this World, are but like Childrens Toys to us; we are a while diſpoſed to play with them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; but afterwards we are fain to throw them aſide.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they generally indiſpoſe our Bodies. Let the Drunkard but conſider how weariſom a Vice is his, how it Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes his Body ten times more than the ſevereſt Labour, how it makes him drudg at his Glaſs, more than he would do at the Oar; let him think, if after his hight of Jollity, the Morrow is not a Day of Sorrow, if the preſent Indiſpoſition he feels doth not make his Crowned Bowels more Nauſeous to him, than his Phyſitians Drugs. Let the Luſtful Man ſpeak, if his broken Conſtitution and his Stupid Soul, that hangs as looſe about him as his Joynts, does not take off his Appetite from that Vice, which has ſo enervated both his Body
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97801:114"/>
and Mind. Nay, even our Paſtimes, which are to refreſh us after our Labour, in a ſhort time weary us themſelves; ſo that at laſt we are forced to take Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again in Labour, to recreate us upon their Tireſomneſs,</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Pleaſures of this World ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, becauſe we muſt in a very little while leave them.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT would be an inexcuſable piece of folly, for a Man to fall in Love with the Inn he is to Lodg in but one Night, becauſe it is perhaps a pretty contrived place, and he has all things handſomly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. A Wiſe Man would rather conſider, that tho' this is a pretty Place, yet it can ſignifie but little to him, who is ſo very ſhortly to leave it; if he was always to live there, it was ſomething, but he muſt away from it the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that it is in vain to ſet his Affections upon that, which he cannot ſtay to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them with. Now why ſhould we not be as Wiſe, as to our thoughts about the things of this Life. The Scripture tells us over and over, and our Reaſon convinces
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97801:115"/>
us, that this Life is but a Pilgrimage and a time of ſojourning; that to be enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the good things of this World is as fooliſh, as to intend a Journey, and to take up our Habitation upon the Road. Nay, the time we are to Lodg at an Inn takes up ſome valuable part of the ſpace of our ſhort Life; for the youngeſt Man cannot expect to live fourty thouſand times longer than the twelve hours he is to ſtay there. But the time we have to ſtay in this World bears no proportion to the time we muſt live in the next. All the time we have to live here is not much, if we conſider it in it ſelf, threeſcore and ten years (granting we live ſo long) are not the threeſcore and tenth part of the time; which the World has already continued; Nay, farther if we had lived the whole five thouſand years, it would have been nothing to Eternity, it would not have been ſo much as one Unite, to all the Figures in a Table of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garithms ſet at Length; not ſo much as one Atome to the whole <hi>Magnus Orbis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But without this Conſideration, the bare thoughts of being once to part with the Pleaſures of this World, are enough to damp our Spirits, and quell our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards them. Let but the Great Man conſider, that a time will come, when
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97801:115"/>
he ſhall lie faint and drooping upon his laſt Bed; when all his dainty Confections and Artificial Diſhes ſhall be Flat and Inſipid to his Decay'd Palat; when all the Jolly Mirth of a Drinking Entertainment ſhall be changed, for the Melancholy Looks of Grieving Friends, and a deſpairing Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; when his Bags of Gold, and his large Poſſeſſions can no more comfort his Soul, than they can relieve his Body; when he ſhall find his Eſtate muſt be left whither he will or no, and that the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Heir is there ready to catch the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Inheritance; that he muſt ſhortly change his Coſtly Robes for a few Vile Weeds of Flax or Flannel; that he muſt loſe his Splendid and Delightful Manſion, for a Dark and Cold Grave, where he that has Commanded the Knees of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine Supplicants, ſhall be trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Foot of every Poor Goer-by. And when a Man ſeriouſly conſiders this, he will not be ſo greatly Enamoured of thoſe things, which he is ſo certain to part with, and it may be ſo very ſoon; which he muſt go perfectly ſtript of into the other World, and may be ſome time without enjoying them in this.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have before conſidered, how great the Happineſs of another World is, and therefore, if we have any Reaſon or Senſe, we muſt look upon all the Pleaſures of this World, as but poor and pitiful things, in reſpect of that.
